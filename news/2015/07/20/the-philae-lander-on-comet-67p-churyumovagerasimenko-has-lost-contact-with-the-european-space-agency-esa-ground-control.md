#  The Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has lost contact with the European Space Agency (ESA) ground control. 

Europe&#39;s robot lab Philae has fallen &quot;silent&quot; on the surface of a comet zipping towards the sun. Ground controllers fear it may have shifted out of radio contact indefinitely.
