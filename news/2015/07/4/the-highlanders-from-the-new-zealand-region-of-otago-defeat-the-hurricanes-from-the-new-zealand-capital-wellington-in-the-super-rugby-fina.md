#   The Highlanders from the New Zealand region of Otago defeat the Hurricanes from the New Zealand capital Wellington in the Super Rugby final, 21-14. It is the Highlanders' first Super 15 final. 

They had knocked off the Chiefs in Dunedin, then bamboozled the Waratahs in Sydney, but few thought they could beat the regular season champion Hurricanes on their home patch.
