# An Iraqi Air Force Sukhoi Su-25 jet, returning from a bombing raid against ISIL militants in the north, accidentally drops a bomb on Baghdad destroying several homes and killing at least 7 civilians. American officials claimed that as many as 65% of Iraqi air force bombers do not drop their bombs due to "lack of targets". 

Seven people die and 11 are hurt as a bomb falls from a Sukhoi Su-25 jet returning from a raid against Islamic State targets.
