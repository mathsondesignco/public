# Negotiation of a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran. A nuclear deal is reached in Vienna between Iran and P5+1. This Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if signed by the entities involved, will cut off Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon whilst allowing for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, inspections, and the lifting of sanctions. 

After years of negotiations, world powers reach a deal with Iran on limiting Iranian nuclear activity in return for the lifting of sanctions.
