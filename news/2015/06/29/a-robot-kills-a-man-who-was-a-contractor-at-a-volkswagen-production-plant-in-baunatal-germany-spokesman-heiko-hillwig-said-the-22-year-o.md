# A robot kills a man, who was a contractor, at a Volkswagen production plant in Baunatal, Germany. Spokesman Heiko Hillwig said the 22-year-old victim was part of a team that was setting up the robot when it grabbed and crushed him against a metal plate. The death was preliminarily attributed to human error, rather than any issue with the robot itself; prosecutors are contemplating whether to charge anybody.
