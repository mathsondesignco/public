# The wreckage of a small plane carrying eight passengers on a shore excursion from Holland America Line's ''MS Westerdam'' cruise ship is discovered near the Alaskan town of Ketchikan. All nine people on board including the pilot died. 

A recovery team will attempt to reach the wreckage of a sightseeing plane Friday to begin the grim task of removing the bodies of the pilot and eight passengers from a Seattle-based cruise ship.
