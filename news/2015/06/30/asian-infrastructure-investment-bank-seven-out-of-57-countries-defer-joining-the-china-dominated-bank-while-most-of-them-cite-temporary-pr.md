# Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank: Seven out of 57 countries defer joining the China-dominated bank. While most of them cite temporary procedural constraints at home, political reasons are involved with the case of the Philippines amid a territorial dispute with China in South China Sea. 

The Philippines has put off signing an agreement to join the China-led Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB), noting the need to carefully study the proposal.
