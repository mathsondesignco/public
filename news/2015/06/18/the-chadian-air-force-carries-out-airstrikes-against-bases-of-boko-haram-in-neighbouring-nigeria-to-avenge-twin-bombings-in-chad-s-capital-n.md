# The Chadian Air Force carries out airstrikes against bases of Boko Haram in neighbouring Nigeria to avenge twin bombings in Chad's capital N'Djamena three days ago. 

At least 13 people have died and 53 others have been injured in northeast Nigeria after an explosive device detonated, says a health official and vigilantes helping the military against Boko Haram.
