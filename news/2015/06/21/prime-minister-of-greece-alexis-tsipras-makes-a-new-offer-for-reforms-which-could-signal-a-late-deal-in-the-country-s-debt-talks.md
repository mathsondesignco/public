# Prime Minister of Greece Alexis Tsipras makes a new offer for reforms which could signal a late deal in the country's debt talks. 

Greek debt talks are resuming after creditors accused the country&#x27;s Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of failing to compromise. Greece faces a 1.6 billion euro debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday, and is thought to require a new deal to avoid default and a possible withdrawal from the eurozone.
