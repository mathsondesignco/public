# The government of the island nation of Vanuatu declares a state of emergency for Shefa Province containing the capital Port Vila as authorities struggle to assess the full impact of the category 5 storm. Once assessments of the damage have been done in other provinces, authorities are likely to widen the declared area in a state of emergency. 

Government says there are fears of widespread destruction and heavy loss of life after several islands were directly hit by eye of category five superstorm
