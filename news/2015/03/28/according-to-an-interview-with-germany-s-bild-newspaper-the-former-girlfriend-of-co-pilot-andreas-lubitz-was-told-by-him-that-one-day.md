# According to an interview with Germany's ''Bild'' newspaper, the former girlfriend of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was told by him that "One day I'm going to do something that will change the whole system, and everyone will know my name and remember." 

The co-pilot of the Germanwings Airbus which crashed in the French Alps predicted &quot;one day everyone will know my name&quot;, his ex-girlfriend says.
