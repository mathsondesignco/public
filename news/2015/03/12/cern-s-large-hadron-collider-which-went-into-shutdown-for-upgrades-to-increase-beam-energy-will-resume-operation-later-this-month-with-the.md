# CERN's Large Hadron Collider, which went into shutdown for upgrades to increase beam energy, will resume operation later this month with the hope of creating more Higgs boson particles. 

CERN hopes to find dark matter this year with its refitted LHC, which can produce beams powerful enough to melt a car.
