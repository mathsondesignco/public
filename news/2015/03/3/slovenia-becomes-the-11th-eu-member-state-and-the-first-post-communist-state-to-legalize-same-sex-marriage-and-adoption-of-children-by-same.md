# Slovenia becomes the 11th EU member state and the first post-communist state to legalize same-sex marriage and adoption of children by same-sex couples, after a parliamentary vote of 51&ndash;28. 

Slovenia joined a growing number of European countries that allow same-sex marriages late on Tuesday, almost three years after a similar law was rejected in a national referendum.
