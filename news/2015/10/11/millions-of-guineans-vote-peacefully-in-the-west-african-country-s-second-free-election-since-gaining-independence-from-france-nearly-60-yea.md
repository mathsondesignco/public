# Millions of Guineans vote peacefully in the West African country's second free election since gaining independence from France nearly 60 years ago. Ballot counting started; the provisional outcome is not expected until the end of this week, an official said. Incumbent President Alpha Conde is expected to win reelection. 

The country&#39;s constitutional court has ruled out postponing Sunday&#39;s election despite calls from opposition parties. Incumbent Alpha Conde faces challenges from six other hopefuls but is likely to retain the top job.
