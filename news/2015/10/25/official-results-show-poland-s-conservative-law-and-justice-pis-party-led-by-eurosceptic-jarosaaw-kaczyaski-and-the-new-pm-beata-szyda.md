# Official results show Poland's conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, led by eurosceptic Jaroslaw Kaczynski and the new PM Beata Szydlo, won more seats than any other party in today's general elections. Kaczynski is the twin brother of the late President Lech Kaczynski, who died in a 2010 jet crash. Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz has conceded defeat. 

Poland&#039;s conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party led by eurosceptic Jaroslaw Kaczynski won an absolute majority in general elections on Sunday, public broadcaster TVP projected, a victory ending eight years of centrist rule.
