# The European Union narrowly votes (285-281) to recommend that its 28 member nations drop criminal charges against Edward Snowden and protect him from U.S. extradition and to recognize him as a defender of human rights because of his revelations regarding U.S. and British spying. 

Edward Snowden might set up residence in any of nearly 30 European nations after their governing body passed a resolution to protect the whistleblower.
