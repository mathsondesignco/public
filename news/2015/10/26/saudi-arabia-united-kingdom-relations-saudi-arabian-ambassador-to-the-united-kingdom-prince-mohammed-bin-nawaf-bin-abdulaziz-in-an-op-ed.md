# Saudi Arabia-United Kingdom relations: Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United Kingdom Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf bin Abdulaziz, in an op-ed piece in the "The Daily Telegraph", warns of "potentially serious repercussions" for the two countries' relationship unless a more respectful discourse developed. At issue is London's withdrawal from a GBP5.9m (US$9.1m) prison deal with Saudi Arabia which has been linked to London's concerns about a death penalty case and a case involving Karl Andree, a 74-year-old Briton who faces 350 lashes. Today, the Saudi Supreme Court confirmed Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr's death sentence. 

RIYADH: Saudi Ambassador to the UK Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf has warned of &quot;potentially serious repercussions&quot; of a breakdown in relations with Britain, which no longer reciprocates on issues with similar trust and respect. In an article published in British daily &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; Monday, Prince Mohammed raised several pertinacious questions that need to be addressed by the two countries.
