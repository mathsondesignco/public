# USAA, one of the largest financial services companies in the U.S., announced the ending of its long-term relationship with MasterCard. The tenth-largest credit card issuer in the U.S. will replace the old credit cards with Visa cards next year. 

USAA, one of the nationâ€™s largest issuers of debit cards and credit cards, is switching its portfolio to Visa Inc., representing a blow for longtime partner MasterCard Inc., which processed transactions on its network for roughly 30 years.
