# At least nine people are dead as Typhoon Mujigae hits southern China in the midst of the country's weeklong National Day holiday.  Mujigae also generates several strong tornadoes and leaves dozens of fishermen missing. Nearly 200,000 people had been evacuated before the storm made landfall. Neighboring Guangxi Zhuang region orders 12,700 fishing boats and 35,400 offshore workers to return to port. 

Typhoon Mujigae prompted evacuation of about 200,000 people in southern China.
