# Nineteen-year old Cameron Selmon died during last night's shooting on the Tennessee State University campus when a fight erupted during a dice game, in which a player pulled out a gun and started firing. One of the three injured 18-year-old female students remains hospitalized. The suspect fled the scene on foot and is still at large. The school is closed today but will re-open with Monday classes. 

Mayor Megan Barry pledged to repair the damage violence had done on TSUâ€™s campus and the surrounding neighborhood.
