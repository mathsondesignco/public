# The death toll from Thursday's landslide in the Guatemalan village of El Cambray Dos increased to 152 with more than 300 people missing. No survivors have been found at the site. Search crews have found entire families who died huddled together and buried alive. The Guatemala's National Disaster Reduction Commission, known as the Conred, declared the area uninhabitable. 

Hopes are fading in Guatemala of more survivors of a landslide on the outskirts of the capital that has killed at least 131 people and left 300 missing.
