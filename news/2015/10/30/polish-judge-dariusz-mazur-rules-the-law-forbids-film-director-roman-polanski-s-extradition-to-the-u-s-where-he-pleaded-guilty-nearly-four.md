# Polish Judge Dariusz Mazur rules the law forbids film director Roman Polanski's extradition to the U.S. where he pleaded guilty nearly four decades ago to having sex with a minor. The prosecutors can appeal the ruling. 

The film director served 42 days in prison in 1977 after pleading guilty to having sex with a minor but then fled to France.
