# Bahrain recalls its ambassador to Iran and expels the Iranian acting ''charge d'affaires'' who is declared ''persona non-grata'', a day after Bahraini security forces discovered a large bomb-making factory in Nuwaidrat and arrested a number of suspects linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Bahrain's decision to recall its ambassador comes "in light of continued Iranian meddling in the affairs of the kingdom of Bahrain in order to create sectarian strife and impose hegemony and control." 

Bahrain said Thursday it had recalled its ambassador to Iran, a day after it said security forces had discovered a large bomb-making factory and arrested a number of suspects linked to Iranâ€™s Revolutionary Guard.
