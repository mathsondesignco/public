# As Hurricane Joaquin, still a Category 3 storm, heads northeast,  a Tropical Storm Warning and a Hurricane Watch are in effect for Bermuda. Winds will begin to strengthen early Saturday with thunderstorms and more significant showers around midnight. Joaquin should turn toward the north-northeast Sunday and pass around 125|nmi|abbr=off west of Bermuda that evening. 

A VIOLENT Atlantic hurricane shaping up to be one of the most powerful on record has changed course towards Britain.
