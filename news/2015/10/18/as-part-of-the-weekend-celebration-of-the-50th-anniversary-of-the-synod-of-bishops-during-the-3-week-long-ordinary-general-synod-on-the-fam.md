# As part of the weekend celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Synod of Bishops, during the 3-week-long Ordinary General Synod on the Family, Pope Francis canonizes the parents of the Doctor of the Church, Saint Therese of the Child Jesus of Lisieux, France (Saints Louis Martin and Marie-Azelie Guerin Martin, 1823-1894 and 1831-1877, respectively), the first married Catholic parents to be canonized at the same time. He also canonizes the religious superior general Saint Maria de la Purisima Salvat Romero (Mary of the Immaculate Conception), 1926-1998, and the diocesan priest and founder of a religious institute, Saint Vincenzo Grossi, 1845-1917.
