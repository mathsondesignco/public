#  The Cassini probe makes a close flyby of Saturn's sixth-largest moon, Enceladus, coming within approximately 49 km of the surface and passing through the icy plume above the south pole. The transit of the plume was the deepest to date. Photographs and other data from the mission are expected within 48 hours. 

The Cassini spacecraft has made a final ultra-close flyby of Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, to &quot;taste&quot; the water it is spewing into space.
