#  An article published in ''Nature'' reports high levels of molecular oxygen found by the Rosetta space probe on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.  This discovery could have implications for theories of the origin of the solar system. 

The Rosetta spacecraft has detected significant levels of molecular oxygen coming from a comet, in a discovery that has taken astronomers by surprise.
