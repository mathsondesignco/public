# A military JLENS blimp from the United States Army broke loose from its moorings at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, and drifted over 16,000 ft above Pennsylvania. F-16 Fighter jets were scrambled to track the blimp that has since deflated, causing widespread power outages from a long cable it dragged along the ground. 

The blimp broke loose at Aberdeen proving ground in Maryland and drifted over Pennsylvania before coming down in Moreland Township, NORAD said.
