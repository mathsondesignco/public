# Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant: American-led intervention in Iraq (2014-present): A joint early-morning raid conducted by Iraqi and US forces on an IS-run prison in Hawija, Kirkuk Province has freed 70 hostages. One U.S. Delta Force soldier was reported killed - the first American combat death since the start of the US-led intervention against IS. 

US authorities say US and Iraqi forces rescued dozens of hostages from IS to prevent their &quot;imminent execution&quot; but a US soldier was killed.
