# Myanmar general election, 2015. Voters in Myanmar head to the polls with the National League for Democracy, the party of Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi, expected to win a majority of seats in Parliament and the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party conceding defeat on Monday. Early indication is an 80 percent turnout of the more than 30 million people eligible to vote. 

Voters across the former military dictatorship of Myanmar went to the polls Sunday here in a watershed election, the first in 25 years whose outcome wasn&apos;t a foregone conclusion.
