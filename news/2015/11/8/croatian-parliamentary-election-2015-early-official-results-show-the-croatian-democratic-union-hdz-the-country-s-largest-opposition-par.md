# Croatian parliamentary election, 2015: Early official results show the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), the country's largest opposition party, has a slim lead over Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic-s ruling Social Democrats (SDP) in today's elections. With 32 percent counted, the HDZ, has 61 of parliament-s 151 seats and the SDP is second with 53. The third place Most (Bridge of Independent Lists) party is likely to have the balance of power in the parliament. 

Croatiaâ€™s ruling center-left coalition faces a strong challenge from a conservative opposition as the Balkan country goes to the polls in its first parliamentary election since joining the European Union in 2013.
