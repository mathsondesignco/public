# The ''Detroit Free Press'' reports, following this week's election, Hamtramck, Michigan, will apparently be the first city in the United States to be governed by Muslims, three of Bangladeshi descent and one Yemeni. Community leader Bill Meyer, who is not Muslim, said the influx of Muslims to Hamtramck has "helped bring stability, security and sobriety while lessening the amount of drugs and crime in the city." 

Once known as a Polish center, Hamtramck now has big Arab and Bangladeshi population as council becomes Muslim-majority
