# 2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown. Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan warns Russia not to "play with fire" and says Russia is supporting the "state terrorism" of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria that has "killed 380,000 people". Relations between the former Cold War antagonists have been severely damaged after Turkey shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 near the Syria-Turkey border on November 24, 2015. 

A war of words between Turkey and Russia escalates as Putin accuses the US of knowing the flight path of the downed Russian jet.
