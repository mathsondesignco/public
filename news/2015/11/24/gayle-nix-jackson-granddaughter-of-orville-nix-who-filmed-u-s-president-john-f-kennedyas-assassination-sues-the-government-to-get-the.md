# Gayle Nix Jackson, granddaughter of Orville Nix who filmed U.S. President John F. Kennedy's assassination, sues the government to get the original copy of her grandfather's movie back -- or to get paid for it. A former FBI analyst said, "The film is a mirror image of the Zapruder film from the other side of Dealey Plaza."
