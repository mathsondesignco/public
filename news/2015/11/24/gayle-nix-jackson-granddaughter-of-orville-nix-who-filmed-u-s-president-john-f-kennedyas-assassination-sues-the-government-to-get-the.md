# Gayle Nix Jackson, granddaughter of Orville Nix who filmed U.S. President John F. Kennedy's assassination, sues the government to get the original copy of her grandfather's movie back -- or to get paid for it. A former FBI analyst said, "The film is a mirror image of the Zapruder film from the other side of Dealey Plaza." 

A woman whose grandfather filmed the assassination of John F Kennedy on a home movie sues the US government for its return.
