# 2015 Roubaix shootings: At least one person is killed after a group of armed men took people hostage in the northern French town of Roubaix near the Belgian border. The hostages are thought to be a bank director and his family. French police say the incident may be related to a robbery and not to the November 2015 attacks in Paris. 

A hostage situation in a town in northern France has ended tonight.
