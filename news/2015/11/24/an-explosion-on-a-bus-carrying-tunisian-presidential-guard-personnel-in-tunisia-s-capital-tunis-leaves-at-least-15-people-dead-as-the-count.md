# An explosion on a bus carrying Tunisian Presidential Guard personnel in Tunisia's capital Tunis leaves at least 15 people dead, as the country's government declares a state of emergency. 

At least 12 people have died after a bus carrying the Tunisian presidential guard was blown up on a main road in Tunis in an &quot;act of terror&quot;. The blast occurred on Mohamed V Avenue, at the heart of the Tunisian capital, according to a spokesman for the North African country&#039;s Interior Ministry. In the hours following the attacks, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi declared a state of emergency throughout the country and curfew in the capital city.
