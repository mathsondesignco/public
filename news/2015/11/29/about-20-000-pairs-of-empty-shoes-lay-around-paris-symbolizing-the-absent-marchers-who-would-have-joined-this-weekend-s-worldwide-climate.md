# About 20,000 pairs of empty shoes lay around Paris, symbolizing  the absent marchers who would have joined this weekend's worldwide climate change protests pressing for a bold international agreement at the upcoming climate summit there. The capital city was planned to be the center for demonstrations but French police banned large protests following the terrorist attacks this month. 

The Pope, actress Marion Cotillard and designer Vivienne Westwood were among those that left their footwear along with messages of support after the march was banned due to security fears
