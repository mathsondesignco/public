# The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Japanese manufacturer of airbags Takata Corp. agree to a five-year consent decree where the  company agrees to pay a civil penalty of $70 million and faces as much as $130 million more in fines if it violates the settlement. Twelve automakers are ordered to speed up recalls that  so far have only reached about a quarter of the affected cars. 

The Japanese maker of air bags linked to the deaths or injuries of dozens of motorists has agreed to pay a record U.S. civil penalty of up to $200 million and have an independent monitor oversee the nationâ€™s largest-ever automotive safety recall.
