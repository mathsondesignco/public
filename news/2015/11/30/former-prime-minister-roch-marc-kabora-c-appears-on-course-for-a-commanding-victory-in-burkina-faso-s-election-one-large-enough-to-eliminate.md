# Former prime minister Roch Marc Kabore appears on course for a commanding victory in Burkina Faso's election, one large enough to eliminate the need for a run-off. According to the Independent National Electoral Commission, with results from about 72 percent of the country counted, Kabore has 54 percent of the vote with his closest challenger, former finance minister Zephirin Diabre, getting 29 percent.
