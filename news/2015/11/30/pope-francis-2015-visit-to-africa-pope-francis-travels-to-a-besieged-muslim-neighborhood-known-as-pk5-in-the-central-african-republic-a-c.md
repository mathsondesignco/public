# Pope Francis' 2015 visit to Africa: Pope Francis travels to a besieged Muslim neighborhood known as PK5 in the Central African Republic, a country wracked by sectarian violence. This visit is part of Francis's message of peace and reconciliation. As a result of the violence over the last two years, most of the capital Bangui's 100,000-plus Muslims have fled; now only 15,000 remain. 

Pope Francis visits a mosque in the capital of the Central African Republic, and calls for religious harmony in a country divided along religious lines.
