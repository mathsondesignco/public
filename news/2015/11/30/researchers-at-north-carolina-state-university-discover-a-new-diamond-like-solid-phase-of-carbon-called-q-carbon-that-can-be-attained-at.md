# Researchers at North Carolina State University discover a new diamond-like, solid phase of carbon, called Q-carbon, that can be attained at room temperature. The result is a uniquely crystalline material, harder than a real diamond and likely boasting a variety of new properties, most unknown or unstudied. 

Researchers at North Carolina State University have discovered a new diamond-like phase of carbon that can be attained at room temperature.
