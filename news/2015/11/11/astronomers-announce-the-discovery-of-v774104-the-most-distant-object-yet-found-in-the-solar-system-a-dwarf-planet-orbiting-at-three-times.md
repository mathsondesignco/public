# Astronomers announce the discovery of V774104, the most distant object yet found in the solar system, a dwarf planet orbiting at three times the distance of Pluto. 

A random search has turned up a dwarf planet orbiting roughly 10 billion miles away. The far-off world is tiny, and probably very, very cold.
