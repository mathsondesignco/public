# Territorial disputes in the South China Sea, China-United States relations: Malaysia-United States relations: U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and his counterpart from Malaysia, Hishammuddin Hussein, will visit the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) as it cruises in the South China Sea, this in the wake of China-s dismay over a U.S. Navy ship-s sailing in the vicinity of artificial islands constructed by China in the Spratly Islands. 

Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein will visit the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt on Thursday as it passes through the South China Sea and conducts routine operations.
