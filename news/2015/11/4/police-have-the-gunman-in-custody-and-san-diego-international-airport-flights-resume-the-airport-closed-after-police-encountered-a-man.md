# Police have the gunman in custody and San Diego International Airport flights resume. The airport closed  after   police encountered a  man with a gun shooting in a Bankers Hill apartment complex, east of the approach path to the  airport. Also known as Lindbergh Field,  the airport is frequently cited as one of the scariest because of its downtown location. 

San Diego police on Wednesday took into custody a gunman who had fired at officers responding to a domestic violence incident after an extended standoff that prompted the nearby international airport to temporarily divert inbound flights.
