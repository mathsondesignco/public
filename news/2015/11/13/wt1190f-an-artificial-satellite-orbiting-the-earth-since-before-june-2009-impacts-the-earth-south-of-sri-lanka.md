# WT1190F, an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth since before June 2009, impacts the Earth south of Sri Lanka. 

A hunk of space junk is expected to fall to Earth in a spectacular light show near Sri Lanka early this Friday the 13th. The prediction has prompted the Sri Lankan government to impose a temporary no-fly zone and a fishing ban as a precaution.
