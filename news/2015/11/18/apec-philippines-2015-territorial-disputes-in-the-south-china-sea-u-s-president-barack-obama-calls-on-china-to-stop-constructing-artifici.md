# APEC Philippines 2015: Territorial disputes in the South China Sea: U.S. President Barack Obama calls on China to stop constructing artificial islands in the South China Sea. Obama-s comments to reporters come after a meeting with Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III. The U.S. president is in Manila for the latest Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit where the Trans-Pacific Partnership is the central topic of conversation. China attempts to keep the topic of the islands off the agenda. 

China is trying its hardest to keep the South China Sea off the agenda -- but the U.S. and Japan have other plans.
