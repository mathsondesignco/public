# Pope Francis makes his first ever visit to the U.S. and becomes the third Pope to visit the White House. He was received in an official welcome ceremony by President and Mrs. Obama and is scheduled to meet with a bishops' conference of the United States and hold mass and canonize Junipero Serra at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, near the Catholic University of America. 

The Pope will arrive at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., wearing his regular white attire but will change into vestments to celebrate the United States&#39; first canonization Mass, for Franciscan missionary Jun√≠pero Serra, on Wednesday.
