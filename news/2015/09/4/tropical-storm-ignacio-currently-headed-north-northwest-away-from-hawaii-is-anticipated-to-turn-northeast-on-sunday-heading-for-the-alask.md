# Tropical Storm Ignacio, currently headed north-northwest away from Hawaii, is anticipated to turn northeast on Sunday, heading for the Alaskan panhandle and northwestern British Columbia. 

Steering winds could take Ignacio, currently a post-tropical cyclone, into the southeastern arm of Alaska or British Columbia during the middle days of next week.
