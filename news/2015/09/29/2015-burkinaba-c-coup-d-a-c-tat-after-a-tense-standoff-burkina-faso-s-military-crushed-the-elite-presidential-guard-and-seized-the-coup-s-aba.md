# 2015 Burkinabe coup d'etat. After a tense standoff, Burkina Faso's military crushed the elite presidential guard and seized the coup's abandoned headquarters. The former head of the guard, Gen. Gilbert Diendere, had called on his men to lay down their weapons to avoid a bloodbath. Diendere told Agence France-Presse (AFP) he feared -many deaths and injuries- in the operation. It is unclear whether there are casualties. 

The short-lived putsch by supporters of former president Blaise Compaor√© has ended after their stronghold was reportedly shelled by the military
