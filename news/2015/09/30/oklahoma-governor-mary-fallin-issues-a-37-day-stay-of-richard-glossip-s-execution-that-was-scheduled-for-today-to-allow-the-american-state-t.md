# Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin issues a 37-day stay of Richard Glossip's execution that was scheduled for today to allow the American state time to address questions about chemicals and protocol. Pope Francis, who spent last week in the U.S., asked Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, to intercede with the governor and request she commute Glossip's sentence.
