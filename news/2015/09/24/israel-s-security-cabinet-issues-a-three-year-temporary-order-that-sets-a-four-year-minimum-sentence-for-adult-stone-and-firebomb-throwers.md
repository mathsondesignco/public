# Israel's security cabinet issues a three-year temporary order that sets a four-year minimum sentence for adult stone- and firebomb-throwers. In addition, new rules of engagement allow police to open fire when the life of a third party is under threat. 

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared &quot;war&quot; on stone-throwing following the death of an Israeli man in an attack earlier this month.
