# Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka's return from the ISS on Saturday sets a new record for time in space, breaking the one fellow countryman Sergei Krikalev set in 2005. Padalka totaled 879 days in space (2.41 years) over five flights. 

Gennady Padalka, who spent several months aboard the International Space Station, has now spent more time in space than any human, clocking more than 2.4 years in space on five missions since 1998.
