# NASA states that it has found the best evidence yet of the existence of liquid water on Mars. The water is not pure but highly poisonous, containing various dissolved salts that on Earth only an extremophile microbe might survive within. 

NASA will detail a major science finding from the agencyâ€™s ongoing exploration of Mars during a news briefing at 11:30 a.m. EDT on Monday, Sept. 28 at the James Webb Auditorium at NASA Headquarters in Washington. The event will be broadcast live on NASA Television and the agency&#039;s website.
