# Operation Martyr Yalcin: At least 30 people have been killed in the southeastern Turkish city of Cizre following clashes between Turkish security forces and pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) supporters. Locals say Cizre has been "under siege" since the military imposed a curfew. 

Dozens of Kurdish militants die in army operations in the Turkish town of Cizre, officials say, as pro-Kurdish MPs say civilians are among the dead.
