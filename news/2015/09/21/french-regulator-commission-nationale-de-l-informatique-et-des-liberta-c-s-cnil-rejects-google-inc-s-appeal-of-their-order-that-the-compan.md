# French regulator Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertes (CNIL) rejects Google, Inc.'s appeal of their order that the company remove 'Right to be forgotten (RTBF)' search results worldwide. Failure to comply could subject Google to sanctions, from -300,000 (US$460,000) to 5 percent of global operating costs.
