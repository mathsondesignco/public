# American for profit education company Corinthian Colleges announces that it will close its remaining more than two dozen colleges in the western United States due to state and federal investigations into its job-placement practices. 

After years of government investigations, Corinthian Colleges Inc. will shut down more than two dozen of its remaining schools, displacing more than 10,000 California students. The move ends the turmoil at what was once one of the nation&apos;s largest for-profit college chains but presents fresh challenges to students, who now must seek transfers or federal loan forgiveness.
