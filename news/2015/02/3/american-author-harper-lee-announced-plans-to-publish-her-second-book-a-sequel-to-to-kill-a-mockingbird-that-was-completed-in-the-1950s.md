# American author Harper Lee announced plans to publish her second book, a sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird", that was completed in the 1950s but misplaced. July 14, 2015 will be the release date for "Go Set a Watchman". 

The new novel Go Set a Watchman, Harper Lee&#039;s first for 55 years, features Scout as an adult woman and, in the author&#039;s words, is &#039;a pretty decent effort&#039;
