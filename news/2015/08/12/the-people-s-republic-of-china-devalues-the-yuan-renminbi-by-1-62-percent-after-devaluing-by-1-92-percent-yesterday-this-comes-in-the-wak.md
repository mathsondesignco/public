# The People's Republic of China devalues the yuan (Renminbi) by 1.62 percent after devaluing by 1.92 percent yesterday. This comes in the wake of a 30% drop of Chinese stocks last month. 

U.S. stocks staged a rebound in late trading Wednesday as the major indexes climbed back from sharp early losses and closed mostly higher.
