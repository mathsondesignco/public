# A study, part of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, examined huge blocks of space as distant as several billion light years away and concluded that the universe is "slowly dying" as more stars gradually go out faster than they are being replaced by light-emitting active ones. In cosmological terms, the demise of the universe (the current age calculated at approximately 13.8 billion years) is billions, perhaps trillions of years away.
