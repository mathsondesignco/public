# The Dow Jones Industrial Average drops and closes down 530.94 points, or 3.12 percent, with the NASDAQ and S&P 500 also down more than 3%. 

Fears of a China-led global economic slowdown drove Wall Street to its steepest one-day drop in nearly four years on Friday and left the Dow industrials more than 10 percent below a May record.
