# Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit reports that Tropical Storm Erika has left at least 12 dead and more than 20 missing. Erika deposited almost 12 inches of rain in less than 10 hours and caused extensive damage across the island as floods wiped out roads, swamped villages, and started mudslides. 

TAMPAMeteorologists may have remained divided Friday evening on the fate of Tropical Storm Erika, but bay area leaders prepared for the worst following a month of historic flooding.
