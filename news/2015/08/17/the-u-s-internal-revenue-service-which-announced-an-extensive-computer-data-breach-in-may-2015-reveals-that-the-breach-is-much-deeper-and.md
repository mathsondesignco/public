# The U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which announced an extensive computer data breach in May 2015, reveals that the breach is much deeper and more serious, exposing an additional 220,000 individuals. The thieves had infiltrated a now-deactivated online system called "Get Transcript." 

A hack of the Internal Revenue service first reported in May was nearly three times as large as previously believed, the agency said Monday.
