# A court in Egypt postpones a verdict in the prominent trial of two journalists with Al-Jazeera, who have been charged with aiding the Muslim Brotherhood. 

An Egyptian court on Sunday postponed delivering its verdict in the retrial of three Al Jazeera TV journalists, a decision a defense lawyer said was to avoid bad publicity during a visit by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and other dignitaries.
