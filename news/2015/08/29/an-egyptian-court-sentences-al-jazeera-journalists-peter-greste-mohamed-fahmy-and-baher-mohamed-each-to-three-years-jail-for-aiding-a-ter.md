# An Egyptian court sentences Al Jazeera journalists Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy, and Baher Mohamed each to three years jail for "aiding a terrorist organization" and falsifying news. Greste, who earlier was deported to Australia, was tried in absentia. Mohamed, an Egyptian, was sentenced to an additional six months for possession of a spent bullet casing; Fahmy is a Canadian national. 

Peter Greste and his Al Jazeera colleagues Mohammed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed are sentenced to at least three years&#039; jail at a retrial in a Cairo court.
