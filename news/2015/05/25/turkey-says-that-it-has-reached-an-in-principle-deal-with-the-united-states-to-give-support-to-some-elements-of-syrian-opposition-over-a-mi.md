# Turkey says that it has reached an in-principle deal with the United States to give support to some elements of Syrian opposition. Over a million Syrian refugees live in Turkish territory, including many Syrian opposition figures. 

The United States and Turkey have agreed &quot;in principle&quot; to give air support to some forces from Syria&#x27;s mainstream opposition, Turkey&#x27;s foreign minister said, in what if confirmed could mark an expansion of U.S. involvement in the conflict. There was no immediate comment from U.S.
