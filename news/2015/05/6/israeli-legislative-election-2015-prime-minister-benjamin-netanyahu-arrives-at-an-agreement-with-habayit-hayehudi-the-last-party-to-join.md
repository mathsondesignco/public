# Israeli legislative election, 2015: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrives at an agreement with Habayit Hayehudi - the last party to join - just before the midnight deadline for the talks. With Naftali Bennett's party agreeing to a deal, Netanyahu's coalition will number 61 Members of the Knesset - the bare minimum needed. 

Details of deal between Likud and Habayit Hayehudi will be worked out and disclosed next week, ahead of the swearing-in of the new government.
