# In auto racing, a crewman from Aric Almirola's team is airlifted to a hospital during the Winn-Dixie 300 of the NASCAR Xfinity Series, after Brendan Gaughan's vehicle crashed into the pit wall and struck tires and a sign, which then struck the crew member. 

For the second consecutive week, Brendan Gaughan was involved in a scary pit-road incident that sent a crewman from another team to the hospital.
