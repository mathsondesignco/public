# ''The Astrophysical Journal'' publishes research from the University of Rochester and the University of Leiden announcing the discovery of either a brown dwarf substellar object or a gas giant exoplanet titled J1407b. The object is the first known nonstar to have a super ring system. 

Astronomers say they have found the first-ever ringed planet beyond our Solar System.
