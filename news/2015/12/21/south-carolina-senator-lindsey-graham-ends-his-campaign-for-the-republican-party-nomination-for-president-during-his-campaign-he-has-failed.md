# South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham ends his campaign for the Republican Party nomination for President. During his campaign he has failed to poll above single digits nationally or in the early voting states. 

Sen. Lindsey Graham spent seven months pushing his fellow Republicans toward a more aggressive foreign policy -- but failing to catch on with voters -- before deciding to end his presidential campaign.
