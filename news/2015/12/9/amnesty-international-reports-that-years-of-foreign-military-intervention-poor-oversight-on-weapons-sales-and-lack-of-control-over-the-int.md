# Amnesty International reports that years of foreign military intervention, poor oversight on weapons sales, and lack of control over the international flow of weaponry have enabled ISIL to accumulate its vast armaments stockpile. Amnesty International calls for weapons embargoes and the ratification of the global Arms Trade Treaty by nations that have not already done so and, at the same time, are sources of weapons in the ISIL stockpile. 

Decades of irresponsible arms transfers to Iraq fueled the Islamic State group&#039;s firepower and ability to carry out atrocities on a massive scale, Amnesty International said in a report published Tuesday.
