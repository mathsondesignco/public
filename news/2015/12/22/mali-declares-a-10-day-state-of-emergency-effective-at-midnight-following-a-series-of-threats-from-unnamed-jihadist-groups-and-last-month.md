# Mali declares a 10-day state of emergency effective at  midnight, following a series of threats from unnamed jihadist groups, and last month's  siege at a  Bamako hotel, where 20 people were killed. 

After a year of terror attacks, both governments have stopped public gatherings and boosted police powers. The restrictions will last over Christmas, during the Prophet Muhammad&#39;s birthday and into the New Year.
