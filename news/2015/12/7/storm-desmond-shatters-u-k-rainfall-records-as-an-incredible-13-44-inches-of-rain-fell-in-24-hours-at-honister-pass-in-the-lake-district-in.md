# Storm Desmond shatters U.K. rainfall records as an incredible 13.44 inches of rain fell in 24 hours at Honister Pass in the Lake District in North West England. The 15.94 inches of rain at Thirlmere -- also in the Lake District -- set a new record for the 48-hour period. 

Heavy rain is expected tomorrow as the Government pledges to re-examine flood defence spending after the &quot;unprecedented&quot; rainfall.
