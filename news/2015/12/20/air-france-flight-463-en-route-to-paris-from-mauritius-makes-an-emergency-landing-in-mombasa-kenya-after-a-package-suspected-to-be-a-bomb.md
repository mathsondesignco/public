# Air France Flight 463 en-route to Paris from Mauritius makes an emergency landing in Mombasa, Kenya, after a package, suspected to be a bomb is found in the toilet. Later, Air France CEO Frederic Gagey says it was a false alarm; the package contained a mixture of cardboard, sheets of paper, and a timer. 

A Kenyan police official says an Air France flight from Mauritius to Paris has been forced to land in the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa after a device suspected to be a bomb was found.
