# A bushfire in Victoria state  has destroyed 116 homes. The 2200-hectare Jamieson Track blaze razed 98 homes in Wye River and 18 at Separation Creek.  The fire stopped just 500 meters short of Kennett River.  A dousing of rain on Saturday was unlikely to do much in the long term as this blaze could continue into January or February, says emergency management commissioner Craig Lapsley.  No injuries are reported. 

Up to 116 properties have been destroyed by fire at Wye River and Separation Creek in Victoria.
