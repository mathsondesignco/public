# Sixteen people are killed and many more injured by a car bomb and a second, delayed explosion  near a hospital in Syria's mainly Alawite, government-controlled neighborhood of al-Zahra, east of  Homs' old city, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports. The attack comes just five days  after the government and rebels agreed on a local ceasefire in the western al-Waer suburb. 

Syria has suffered another day of death and destruction. This time in the central city of Homs. At least 16 people were killed and scores more
