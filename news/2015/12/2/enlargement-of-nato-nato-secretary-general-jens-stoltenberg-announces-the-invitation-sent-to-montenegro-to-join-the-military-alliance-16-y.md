# Enlargement of NATO. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announces the invitation sent to Montenegro to join the military alliance, 16 years after the country, as part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was bombed by the alliance in the Kosovo War. Montenegro's accession would result in "retaliatory actions", according to a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

Nato invites Montenegro to join the alliance, in its first expansion for six years - prompting Russia to warn that it will retaliate.
