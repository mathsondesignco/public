# The Institute of Contemporary History in Munich announces a publication of a two-volume set of Adolf Hitler's ''Mein Kampf''. The new edition, which contains 3,500 scholarly annotations, is intended, ''The New York Times'' reports, "To set the work in historical context, to show how Hitler wove truth with half-truth and outright lie, and thus to defang any propagandistic effect while revealing Nazism."  This is the first printing in Germany since the end of World War II.
