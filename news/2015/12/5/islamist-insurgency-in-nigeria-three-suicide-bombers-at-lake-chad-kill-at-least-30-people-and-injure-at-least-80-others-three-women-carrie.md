# Islamist insurgency in Nigeria. Three suicide bombers at Lake Chad kill at least 30 people and injure at least 80 others. Three women carried out the attack at a weekly market on an island on the Chadian side of the lake. No group claims responsibility; officials suspect the attacks were carried out by members of the Boko Haram militant group from neighboring Nigeria. 

Three suicide attacks have hit an island on Lake Chad, killing at least 27 people, security sources say.
