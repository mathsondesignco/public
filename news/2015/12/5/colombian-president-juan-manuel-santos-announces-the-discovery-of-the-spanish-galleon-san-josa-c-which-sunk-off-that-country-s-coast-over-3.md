# Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos announces the discovery of the Spanish galleon San Jose which sunk off that country-s coast over 300 years ago. The discovery was a joint venture between Colombia and U.S. firm Sea Search Armada, which filed a lawsuit when Colombia claimed the wreck as a heritage site. The wreck-s cargo is placed somewhere in the $4 to $17 billion range. 

The San Jose sank in 1708. The value of its cargo — believed to include gold, silver, emeralds, and other precious cargo — has been estimated at more than $10 billion.
