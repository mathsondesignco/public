# The public interest non-profit Cause for Action files a Freedom of Information Act request for United States Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter's personal emails following his disclosure of using that account for official government emails, this in the wake of the former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton email controversy and the Office of Personnel Management data breach. The U.S. Federal Records Act restricts use of personal email for official business. 

A government accountability nonprofit wants to see if Defense Secretary Ash Carter violated the Federal Records Act.
