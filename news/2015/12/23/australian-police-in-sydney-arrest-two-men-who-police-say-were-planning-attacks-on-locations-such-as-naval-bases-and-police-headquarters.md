# Australian police in Sydney arrest two men who, police say, were planning attacks on locations such as naval bases and police headquarters. New South Wales Deputy Police Commissioner Catherine Burn said Wednesday's activity brings the number of people arrested in connection with last year's Operation Appleby to 13. 

Two men are arrested in counter-terrorism raids in Sydney after police thwarted what they say were plots to attack locations including a naval base.
