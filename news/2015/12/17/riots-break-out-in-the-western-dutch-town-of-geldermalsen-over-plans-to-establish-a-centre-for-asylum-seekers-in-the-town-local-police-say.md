# Riots break out in the western Dutch town of Geldermalsen over plans to establish a centre for asylum seekers in the town. Local police say they made several arrests. Including this year's arrivals, the Dutch government said in November it expected to receive 58,000 asylum seekers by the end of 2016. 

A meeting in a Dutch down discussing plans to build a centre to house asylum seekers is abandoned after protesters riot.
