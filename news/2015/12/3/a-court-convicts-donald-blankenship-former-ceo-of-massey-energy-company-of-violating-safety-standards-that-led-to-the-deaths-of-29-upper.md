# A court convicts Donald Blankenship, former CEO of Massey Energy Company, of violating  safety standards that led to the deaths of 29 Upper Big Branch mine workers in Montcoal, West Virginia in 2010. He is acquitted of making false statements and deceiving regulators. Blankenship, who faces up to one year in prison and a fine of $250,000, is the most prominent American coal executive ever to be convicted of a charge connected to the deaths of miners. 

For those hoping for a harsher penalty, the compromise verdict was disappointing. But it was also a milestone.
