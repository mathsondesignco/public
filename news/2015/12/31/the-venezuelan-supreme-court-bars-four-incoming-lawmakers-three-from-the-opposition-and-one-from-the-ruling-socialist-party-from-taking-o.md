# The Venezuelan Supreme Court  bars four incoming lawmakers (three from the opposition and one from the ruling Socialist party) from taking office, putting  the opposition's two-thirds legislative "supermajority" at risk, won via a landslide victory in the December 6 election by just one seat. The court is yet to specify the quorum for the new House, which would determine the number of seats needed for a  two-thirds majority.  The new National Assembly convenes Tuesday. 

Responding to a legal challenge filed by supporters of the ruling socialist party, the Supreme Court blocked the four lawmakers from being taking their seats when the new National Assembly convenes Tuesday.
