#  French President Jacques Chirac, in an interview with the "International Herald Tribune", says that if the Government of Iran produces one or two nuclear weapons it will pose little danger to its neighbors. If Iran were to try to use a nuclear weapon against Israel, "It would not have gone off 200 meters into the atmosphere before Tehran would be razed to the ground." He later retracts his statements, saying he did not realize his comments were on the record.
