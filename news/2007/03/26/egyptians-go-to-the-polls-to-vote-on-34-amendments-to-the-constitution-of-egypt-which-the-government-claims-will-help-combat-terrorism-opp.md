#  Egyptians go to the polls to vote on 34 amendments to the constitution of Egypt which the government claims will help combat terrorism. Opposition groups are boycotting the referendum claiming that they will erode civil liberties. The amendments achieved approval with 76% of the vote but with only a 27% turnout. 

Issues of politics were overshadowed by more basic concerns, like lack of jobs, inadequate housing and the price of food.
