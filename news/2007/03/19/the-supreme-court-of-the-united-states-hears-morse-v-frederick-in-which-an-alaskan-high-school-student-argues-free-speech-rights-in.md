#  The  Supreme Court of the United States hears ''Morse v. Frederick'', in which an Alaskan high school student argues free speech rights in connection with his displaying a banner reading "Bong Hits 4 Jesus" in front of a Juneau high school. 

A high school senior&#8217;s 14-foot banner proclaiming &#8220;Bong Hits 4 Jesus&#8221; gave the Supreme Court a provocative prop for a lively argument Monday about the extent of schools&#8217; control over student speech.
