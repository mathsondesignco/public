#  TAM Linhas Aereas Flight 3054 carrying 186 people crashes in Congonhas International Airport, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The death toll is estimated to be at least 200 people. 

The pilot of an airliner that burst into flames after trying to land on a short, rain-slicked runway apparently tried to take off again, barely clearing rush-hour traffic on a major highway. The death toll rose Wednesday to 189 and could climb higher.
