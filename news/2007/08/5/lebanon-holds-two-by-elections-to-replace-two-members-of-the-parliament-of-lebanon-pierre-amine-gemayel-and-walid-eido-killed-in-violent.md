#  Lebanon holds two by-elections to replace two members of the Parliament of Lebanon, Pierre Amine Gemayel and Walid Eido, killed in violent incidents claimed to be murder. Camille Khoury and Mohamad Amin Itani are declared as the winners of the elections although rival candidate Amin Gemayel has lodged a complaint about Khoury's victory. 

Lebanon&#039;s Opposition has won a key by-election that has left the country&#039;s Christians deeply divided ahead of polls to elect a new president, who is traditionally a Christian.
