#  The remains of the RMS Titanic's Unknown Child, initially identified as Eino Viljami Panula, are re-identified by a Canadian research team and found to be those of another young passenger, Sidney Leslie Goodwin. 

Canadian researchers said the body of a nameless child who died aboard the Titanic and was declared a 13-month-old Finnish baby is actually a 19-month-old English boy.
