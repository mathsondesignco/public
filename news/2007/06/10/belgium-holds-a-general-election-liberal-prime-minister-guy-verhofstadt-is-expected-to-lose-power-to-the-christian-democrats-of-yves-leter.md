#  Belgium holds a general election. Liberal Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt is expected to lose power to the Christian Democrats of Yves Leterme. 

Belgian voters punished the liberal-socialist government in an election on Sunday and cleared the way for Flemish premier Yves Leterme to become prime minister and pursue a devolution of power to the regions.
