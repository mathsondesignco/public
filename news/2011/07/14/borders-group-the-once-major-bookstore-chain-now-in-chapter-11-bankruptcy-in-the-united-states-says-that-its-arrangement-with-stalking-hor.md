# Borders Group, the once-major bookstore chain now in chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, says that its arrangement with stalking horse bidder Najafi Companies has collapsed, and it will seek a modification of bid procedures.  

Borders Group Inc BGPIQ.PK moved closer to going out of business as a bankruptcy judge approved a plan to liquidate the second-largest U.S. book retailer after a sale to private equity firm Najafi Cos fell apart.
