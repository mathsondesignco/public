# In swimming, Ryan Lochte of the United States sets a new world record in the 200-meter individual medley in winning a gold medal at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Lochte becomes the first person to set a long-course world record since FINA banned rubberized swimsuits in 2010. 

Ryan Lochte continued to hold Michael Phelps at bay in an event Phelps used to own, the 200-meter individual medley, winning his second consecutive world title in the event and setting a world record of 1:54.00.
