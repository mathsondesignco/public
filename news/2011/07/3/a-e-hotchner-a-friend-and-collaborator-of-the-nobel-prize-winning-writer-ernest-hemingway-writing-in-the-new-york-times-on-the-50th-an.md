Hotchner, a friend and collaborator of the Nobel Prize-winning writer Ernest Hemingway, writing in "The New York Times" on the 50th anniversary of Hemingway's death, expresses his belief that the J. Edgar Hoover-led Federal Bureau of Investigation's surveillance "substantially contributed to his anguish and his suicide", with Hotchner saying he "regretfully misjudged" Hemingway's fear of the FBI.
