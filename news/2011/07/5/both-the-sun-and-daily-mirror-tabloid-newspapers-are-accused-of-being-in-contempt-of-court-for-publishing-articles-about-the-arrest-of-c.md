# Both "The Sun" and "Daily Mirror" tabloid newspapers are accused of being in contempt of court for publishing articles about the arrest of Christopher Jefferies in relation to the murder of Joanna Yeates; Jefferies was later released without charge. British Attorney General Dominic Grieve is seeking to bring charges against the newspapers. Judges will make a decision on the case at a later date.

Two national newspapers published articles following the arrest of a man over the killing of Jo Yeates which were in contempt of court, the High Court hears.
