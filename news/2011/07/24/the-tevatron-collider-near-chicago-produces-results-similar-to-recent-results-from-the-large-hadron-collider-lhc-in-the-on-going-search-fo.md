# The Tevatron collider near Chicago produces results similar to recent results from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the on-going search for the Higgs Boson. 

A US particle machine has also seen possible hints of the Higgs boson, it emerges, following reports of similar glimpses at the Large Hadron Collider.
