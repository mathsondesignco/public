# Dutch scientists build a nanoscopic electric car made of a single complex molecule. Currently the world's smallest vehicle, the nanocar is capable of travelling small distances when an electric current is applied to it. 

Scientists report the design and test-driving of a single molecule with four &quot;wheels&quot;, powered by electron &quot;fuel&quot;.
