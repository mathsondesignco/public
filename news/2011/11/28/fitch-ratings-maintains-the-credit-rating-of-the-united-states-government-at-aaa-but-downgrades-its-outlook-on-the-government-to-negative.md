# Fitch Ratings maintains the credit rating of the United States government at AAA, but downgrades its outlook on the government to negative. This follows rival ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating in August. 

Fitch said it was revising its outlook on the U.S. credit rating to negative from stable, while keeping its ‘AAA’ rating intact.
