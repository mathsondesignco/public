# Law enforcement in Brazil occupy Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro's biggest ''favela'' or slum, in a bid to clean the city ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics. 

More than 3,000 police and soldiers backed by armored personnel carriers raced into Brazil&#39;s biggest slum before dawn Sunday, quickly gaining control of a shantytown ruled for decades by a heavily armed drug gang.
