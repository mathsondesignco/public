# The U.S. Department of Energy publishes 2010 greenhouse gases levels, showing they are higher than the worst-case scenario outlined by IPCC climate experts just four years ago. 

Based on the latest U.S. Department of Energy calculations of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere, it looks like the world is going for the &quot;business as usual&quot; route.
