# Resignation of Silvio Berlusconi:. Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi narrowly wins a key budget vote in the Italian Parliament, but loses his parliamentary absolute majority as both allied and opposition politicians call on him to resign. 

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said on Tuesday he would resign after suffering a humiliating setback in parliament that showed a party revolt had stripped him of a majority.
