# NASA observes the asteroid YU<sub>55</sub> as it makes a close Earth flyby, passing within 0.85 lunar distances (about 201,700 miles) of the Earth. YU<sub>55</sub> is approximately {{convert|400|m|ft}} across, and is the largest asteroid to make a close pass since 1976. 

A 400m-wide asteroid passes by Earth, on a path closer to the planet than the Moon, much to the delight of astronomers.
