# The Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key warns that the container ship Rena which ran agound on Astrolabe Reef a week ago could break up as oil slicks have appeared on beaches near Tauranga. 

The second officer of the Rena is facing a charge under the Maritime Transport Act as the fears grow that the stricken ship will disintegrate.
