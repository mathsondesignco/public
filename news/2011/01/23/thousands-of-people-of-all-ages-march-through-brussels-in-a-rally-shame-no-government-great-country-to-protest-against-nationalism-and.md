# Thousands of people of all ages march through Brussels in a rally, "Shame: No government, great country", to protest against nationalism and the lack of a proper government for the past seven months. The protest is initially started by students but soon expands to other parts of society. 

Thousands march in Brussels to demand political rivals form a government after seven-month political impasse.
