# Israeli inquiry into the Gaza flotilla raid:An Israeli inquiry finds its own army acts "legal pursuant to the rules of international law" during May's fatal Gaza flotilla raid in which 9 Turkish activists were killed; a separate United Nations inquiry said there had been an "unacceptable level of brutality". The inquiry also declares Israel's naval blockade of Gaza to be legal. 

Contradicting a UN report, panel exonerates military of wrongdoing in the raid on Turkish aid flotilla.
