# Laurent Gbagbo's "Street General" postpones plans for its youth militia to storm the Golf Hotel, where Alassane Ouattara is currently staying, the area surrounded by the New Forces. Supporters of Ouattara renew calls to depose Gbagbo by military intervention. 

Charles Ble Goude, the notorious &#039;Street General&#039; of Ivory Coast&#039;s president Laurent Gbagbo, has called off an appeal to launch an assault on the Abidjan hotel where Alassane Ouattara is besieged.
