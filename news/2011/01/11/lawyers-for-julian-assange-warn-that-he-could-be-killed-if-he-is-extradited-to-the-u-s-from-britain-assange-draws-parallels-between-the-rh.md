# Lawyers for Julian Assange warn that he could be killed if he is extradited to the U.S. from Britain; Assange draws parallels between the rhetoric of the 2011 Tucson shooting and the language used against him by commentators such as Joe Biden, U.S. Vice President. 

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has vowed to step up the website&#039;s release of secret US cables as his defence team warned he could face the death penalty if extradited from the UK.
