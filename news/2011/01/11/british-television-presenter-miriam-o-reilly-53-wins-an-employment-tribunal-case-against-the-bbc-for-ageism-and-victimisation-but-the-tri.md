# British television presenter Miriam O'Reilly, 53, wins an employment tribunal case against the BBC for ageism and victimisation, but the tribunal rejects claims of sexism. She had claimed victimisation after being dropped from the BBC One programme "Countryfile" when it was rescheduled to an evening slot in 2009. 

Miriam O&#039;Reilly, the former Countryfile presenter who has today won her case against the BBC in a tribunal case brought on grounds of ageism, is set to work for the corporation again.
