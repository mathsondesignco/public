# Mark Kennedy, the undercover British police officer who posed as an activist, flees to the United States after his cover is blown. 

The undercover policeman who controversially posed as an environmental activist, last night claimed he had been made a &quot;scapegoat&quot; and was hiding in the US in &quot;genuine fear for [his] life&quot;. Mark Kennedy claimed his undercover policework was highly sensitive and at one time the intelligence he gathered had been passed directly to the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair.
