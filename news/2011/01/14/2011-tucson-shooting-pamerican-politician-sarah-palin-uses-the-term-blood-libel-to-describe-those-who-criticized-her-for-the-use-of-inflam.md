# 2011 Tucson shooting:American politician Sarah Palin uses the term "blood libel" to describe those who criticized her for the use of inflammatory rhetoric, leading to an uproar. 

Sarah Palin was straining to look presidential. With the Stars and Stripes at her side, the former Governor of Alaska read a scripted address in an effort to rebut persistent claims that she was guilty by association over the deaths of six people and the wounding of a further 13, including the Democratic Congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords, at an Arizona supermarket. The charges against her – which arose because the unashamedly gun-toting Palin had placed a rifle target over Arizona during the 2010 election to designate that Giffords was a politician she wanted out of the way – were not only unjust and reprehensible, she intoned soberly, but were &quot;a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they [journalists and pundits] purport to condemn&quot;.
