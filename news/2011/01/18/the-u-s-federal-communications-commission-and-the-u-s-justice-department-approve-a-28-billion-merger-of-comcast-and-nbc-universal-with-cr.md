# The U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Justice Department approve a $28 billion merger of Comcast and NBC Universal with critics complaining of even greater media consolidation in the U.S. and how this merger removes competitive forces and hurts consumers. 

The Justice Department said it reached a settlement with Comcast and NBC Universal that allows the companies to proceed with the deal, subject to some conditions. The Federal Communications Commissions approved the deal 4-1 on Tuesday.
