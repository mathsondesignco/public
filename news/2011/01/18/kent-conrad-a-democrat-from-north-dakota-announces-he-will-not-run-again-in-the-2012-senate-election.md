# Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, announces he will not run again in the 2012 Senate election. 

Sen. Kent Conrad said Tuesday he wants to concentrate on the problems facing America, not his re-election, so he will retire from his seat at the end of his term in 2012, opening up a spot prime for a Republican takeover.
