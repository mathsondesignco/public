# Opposition parties in Ireland are to hold crisis talks to bring down the Brian Cowen-led government after the Green Party pulled out of government yesterday; Fianna Fail no longer has a leader and it no longer has a coalition partner. 

The Irish government and opposition agree a timetable on passing the vital finance bill and dissolving parliament, with elections likely on 25 February.
