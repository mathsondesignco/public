# In rugby league, Darren Lockyer of the Brisbane Broncos plays his 350th match in first grade setting a new record for the National Rugby League. 

THE debate over whether Darren Lockyer should be rugby league&#039;s next Immortal is irrelevant, because he would have to be retired for five years before being considered anyway. But that wouldn&#039;t bother the champion five-eighth, because he would be much more concerned about winning tonight than worrying about his place in history.
