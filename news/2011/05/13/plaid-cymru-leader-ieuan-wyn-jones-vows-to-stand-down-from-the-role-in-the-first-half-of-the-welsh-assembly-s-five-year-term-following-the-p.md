# Plaid Cymru leader Ieuan Wyn Jones vows to stand down from the role in the first half of the Welsh assembly's five-year term following the party's poor results at the recent election. 

Ieuan Wyn Jones reveals he will stand down as Plaid Cymru leader some time in this assembly term, and Lord Elis-Thomas, one of his predecessors, says he may run for the job again.
