# The United States Coast Guard closes a section of the Mississippi River near Caruthersville, Missouri due to heavy flooding. 

Historic flooding forced the U.S. Coast Guard to shut down commercial traffic on part of the Mississippi River Friday as authorities downstream raced to build and reinforce levees, polish evacuation plans and warn residents to start thinking about getting out.
