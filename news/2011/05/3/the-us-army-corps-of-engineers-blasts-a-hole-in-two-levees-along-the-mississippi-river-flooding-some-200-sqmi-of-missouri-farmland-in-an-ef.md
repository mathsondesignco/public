# The US Army Corps of Engineers blasts a hole in two levees along the Mississippi River, flooding some 200 sqmi of Missouri farmland in an effort to save the town of Cairo, Illinois further downriver from record-breaking flood waters. 

The intentional breach of a levee on the Mississippi River is sending 396,000 cubic feet per second of water onto 200 square miles of fertile Missouri farmland. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the operation is helping to ease unprecedented flood pressure on other areas.
