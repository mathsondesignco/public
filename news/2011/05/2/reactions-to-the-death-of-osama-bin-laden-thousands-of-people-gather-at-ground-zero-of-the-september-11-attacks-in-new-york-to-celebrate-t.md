# Reactions to the death of Osama bin Laden:: Thousands of people gather at Ground Zero of the September 11 attacks in New York to celebrate the news that Osama bin Laden has been killed. 

The inability to find bin Laden has frustrated lawmakers throughout Washington for nearly a decade. While they almost uniformly responded with elation to the news, most also warned the terrorist threat is still very much alive.
