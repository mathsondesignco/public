# The "Irish Independent" and "The Belfast Telegraph" begin a week-long joint publication of the Ireland Cables, the latest batch of U.S. diplomatic cables, in co-operation with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. The cables, dating back more than 25 years, feature government members, diplomats, alleged terrorists, oil companies and Vatican insiders. 

The Irish Independent, along with sister newspaper The Belfast Telegraph, have obtained 1,903 US embassy cables from the WikiLeaks organisation that detail the sometimes “murky” underworld of international diplomacy between Ireland and the US. Both newspapers began publishing details contained within the cables today and will do so throughout this week.
