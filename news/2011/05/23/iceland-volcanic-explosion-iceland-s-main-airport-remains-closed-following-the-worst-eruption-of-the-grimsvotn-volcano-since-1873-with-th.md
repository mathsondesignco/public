# Iceland volcanic explosion:. Iceland's main airport remains closed following the worst eruption of the Grmsvtn volcano since 1873, with the ash cloud starting to spread towards Europe. 

Airlines began cancelling flights to Britain late on Monday because of an ash cloud from an Icelandic volcano reaching its airspace, although experts expected no repeat of travel chaos from an eruption a year ago.
