# A 2014 deadline that would have moved a U.S. airbase opposed by politicians and civilians off Okinawa is cancelled following last year's resignation of Prime Minister of Japan Yukio Hatoyama over his own inability to remove the base. 

Japan and the US drop a 2014 deadline to move a controversial airbase on Okinawa, saying it will be moved as soon as possible.
