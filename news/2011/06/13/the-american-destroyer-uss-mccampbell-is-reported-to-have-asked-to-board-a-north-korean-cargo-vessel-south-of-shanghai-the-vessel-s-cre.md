# The American destroyer USS ''McCampbell'' is reported to have asked to board a North Korean cargo vessel south of Shanghai; the vessel's crew refused and later returned home after what ''The New York Times'' described as "several days of pressure" from the U.S. warship. 

The US Navy halted a North Korean cargo vessel bound for Burma two weeks ago over fears it was carrying weapons, US media report.
