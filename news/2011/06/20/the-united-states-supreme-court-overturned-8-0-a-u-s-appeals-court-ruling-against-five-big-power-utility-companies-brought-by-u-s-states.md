# The United States Supreme Court overturned  8-0 a U.S. appeals court ruling against five big power utility companies, brought by U.S. states, New York City, and Land trusts, attempting to force cuts in United States greenhouse gas emissions regarding global warming.  The decision gives deference to reasonable interpretations of the United States Clean Air Act by the Environmental Protection Agency. 

Court said climate change regulation is the business of the federal government, not the states
