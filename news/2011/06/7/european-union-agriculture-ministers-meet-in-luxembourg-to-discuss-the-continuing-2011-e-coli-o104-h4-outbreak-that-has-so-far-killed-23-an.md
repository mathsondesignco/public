# European Union Agriculture Ministers meet in Luxembourg to discuss the continuing 2011 E. coli O104:H4 outbreak that has so far killed 23 and for which no cause has yet been found; a 150 million euro compensation fund is proposed, but no Europe-wide bans on produce. 

The EU health commissioner says the E. coli outbreak that has killed 22 is limited geographically and does not need Europe-wide controls.
