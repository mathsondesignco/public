# Muammar Gaddafi, the leader of Libya, says on state television that he is prepared to enter a ceasefire in the Libyan Civil War but it must apply to both sides. Muammar Gaddafi has made such claims before but each time he failed to uphold one. 

Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi says no-one can force him to leave his country, while suggesting negotiations with Nato.
