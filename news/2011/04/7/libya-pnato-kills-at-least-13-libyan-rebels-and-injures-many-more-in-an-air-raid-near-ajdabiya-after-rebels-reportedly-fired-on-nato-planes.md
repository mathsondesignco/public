# Libya:NATO kills at least 13 Libyan rebels and injures many more in an air raid near Ajdabiya after rebels reportedly fired on NATO planes, though there is speculation that the air-strike may have come from Gaddafi's fighter jets evading the no fly zone. 

Rebels in eastern Libya say their forces have been mistakenly hit by a Nato air strike, and a number of rebel fighters are said to have been killed.
