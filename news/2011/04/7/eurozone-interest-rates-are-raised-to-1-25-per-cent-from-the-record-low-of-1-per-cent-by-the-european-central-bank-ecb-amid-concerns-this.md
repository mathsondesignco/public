# Eurozone interest rates are raised to 1.25 per cent from the record low of 1 per cent by the European Central Bank (ECB) amid concerns this could cause problems for countries such as Portugal and the Republic of Ireland. 

European Central Bank increases eurozone interest rates for the first time since 2008 and admits it will be &quot;unwelcome&quot; for weaker economies.
