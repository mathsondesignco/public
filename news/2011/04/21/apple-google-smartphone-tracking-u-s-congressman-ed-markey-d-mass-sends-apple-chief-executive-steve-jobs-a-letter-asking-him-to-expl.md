# Apple / Google smartphone tracking:. U.S. Congressman Ed Markey (D-Mass.) sends Apple chief executive Steve Jobs a letter asking him to explain the purpose of a file embedded on iPhones and iPads that keeps a detailed log of the devices' location. 

Europe is beginning its own investigations, although the iPhone and iPad have been tracking location data all along.
