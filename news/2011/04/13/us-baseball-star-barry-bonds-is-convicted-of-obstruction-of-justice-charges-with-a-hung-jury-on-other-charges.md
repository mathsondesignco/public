# US baseball star Barry Bonds is convicted of obstruction of justice charges with a hung jury on other charges. 

Barry Bonds was found guilty of obstruction of justice but a jury failed to reach a verdict on three other counts that the home run king lied to a grand jury in 2003 when he specifically denied that he knowingly used steroids and human growth hormone.
