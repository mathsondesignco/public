# The European Union aims to complete Portugal's bailout of approximately EUR80 billion in exchange for cuts before a new government is elected in June, with the previous government having fallen at the loss of a parliamentary vote on imposing similar austerity measures. 

The European Union believes it can complete the Portuguese bail-out, set to be worth 80bn euros, before elections in June.
