# The problems at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant are upgraded to Level 5 on the International Nuclear Events Scale, the same as the Three Mile Island accident. 

Repercussions of Japan&#39;s triple disaster came into clearer focus Monday after the World Bank said the earthquake and tsunami caused up to $235 billion in damage and health officials reported more cases of radiation-tainted vegetables and tap water.
