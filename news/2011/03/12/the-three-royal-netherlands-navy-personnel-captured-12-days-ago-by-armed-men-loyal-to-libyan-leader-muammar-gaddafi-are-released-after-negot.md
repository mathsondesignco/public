# The three Royal Netherlands Navy personnel captured 12 days ago by armed men loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi are released after negotiations after Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Dimitris Dollis secured their release and oversaw their evacuation to Athens, Greece. The crew was trying to rescue a Dutch citizen from Libya when armed men captured them. 

Rebel fighters are driven out of the Libyan port of Ras Lanuf after fierce fighting, leaving the key oil town in the hands of forces loyal to Colonel Gaddafi.
