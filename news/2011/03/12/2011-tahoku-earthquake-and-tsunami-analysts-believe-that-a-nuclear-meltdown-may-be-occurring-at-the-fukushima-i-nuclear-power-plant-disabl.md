# 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Analysts believe that a nuclear meltdown may be occurring at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant disabled by the Japanese earthquake with a state of emergency declared at five plants. 

A March 12 explosion at the earthquake-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Okuma, Japan, appears to have caused a reactor meltdown.
