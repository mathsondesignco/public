# Brian Cowen resigns by requesting the dissolution of the 30th Dail, allowing a general election to take place, the first such election of the eurozone debt crisis. 

Ireland will vote on February 25 in the first general election in Europe dominated by the euro zone debt crisis and by demands to renegotiate an unpopular EU/IMF bailout.
