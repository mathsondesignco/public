# 2011 Yemeni protests: President of Yemen Ali Abdullah Saleh backtracks on his plan to rule Yemen for life and to then allow his son to inherit his rule during an emergency session of parliament ahead of tomorrow's "day of rage" against his three-decade rule. 

Pre-empting mass anti-government protest, Ali Saleh vows not to seek extension and not to pass on the reins to his son.
