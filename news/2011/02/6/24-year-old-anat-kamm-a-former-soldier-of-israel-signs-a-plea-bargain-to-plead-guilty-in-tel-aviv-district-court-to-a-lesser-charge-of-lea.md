# 24-year-old Anat Kamm, a former soldier of Israel, signs a plea bargain to plead guilty in Tel Aviv District Court to a lesser charge of leaking more than 2,000 secret military documents to the "Haaretz" newspaper; she may be jailed for 15 years. "Haaretz" reported a possibly-illegal Israeli assassination operation against Palestinians in the West Bank; her lawyer says she "believed she stumbled onto evidence of war crimes". 

A former Israeli soldier admits leaking secret military information to a newspaper, but more serious spying charges are dropped.
