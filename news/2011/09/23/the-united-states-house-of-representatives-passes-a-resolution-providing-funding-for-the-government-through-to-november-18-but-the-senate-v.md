# The United States House of Representatives passes a resolution providing funding for the Government through to November 18, but the Senate vows to reject it, making a government shutdown from October 1 possible. 

Friday&rsquo;s vote marked a reversal of fortunes for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who after losing Wednesday&rsquo;s vote found himself roaming the contours of a familiar dilemma - capitulate to fiscal hawks in his own party who want to spend less,or compromise with Democrats who want to spend more.
