# The United States Supreme Court decides to delay the execution of Troy Davis, superseding the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles rejection of the request for death row clemency. 

Convicted murderer Troy Davis was executed late Wednesday after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a last-minute appeal.
