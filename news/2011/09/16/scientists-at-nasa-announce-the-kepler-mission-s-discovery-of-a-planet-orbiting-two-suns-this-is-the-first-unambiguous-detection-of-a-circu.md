# Scientists at NASA announce the Kepler mission's discovery of a planet orbiting two suns. This is the first unambiguous detection of a circumbinary planet, i.e., a planet that orbits two stars instead of one. 

A planet orbiting two suns - the first confirmed alien world of its kind, and evoking Tatooine in the film Star Wars - is discovered by Nasa.
