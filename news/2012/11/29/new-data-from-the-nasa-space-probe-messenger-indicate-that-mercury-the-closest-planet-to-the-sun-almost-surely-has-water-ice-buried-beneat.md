# New data from the NASA space probe MESSENGER indicate that Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, almost surely has water ice buried beneath the surface at its north pole. 

A Goddard-built instrument on NASA&#039;s MESSENGER mission provided one of three new lines of evidence that water ice exists near the north pole of Mercury.
