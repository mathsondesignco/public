# A photo of New York City Counterterrorism Officer Lawrence DePrimo, 25, taken today by an Arizona woman and posted on the New York City Police Department's Facebook page, which shows him buying a (normally $100) pair of waterproof winter boots from Skechers for a homeless Times Square man on 42nd Street without any shoes, goes viral, with 1.6 million views and 275,000 likes. 

On a cold November night, Officer Lawrence DePrimo gave boots to a barefoot man. The act of kindness might have gone unnoticed, had it not been for a tourist from Arizona.
