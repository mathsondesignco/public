# Authorities in Bolivar, Missouri, arrest Blaec Lammers, 20, after he is accused of stockpiling weapons in an attempt to commit a copycat crime mirroring the 2012 Aurora shooting, this time targeting the premiere of "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2". 

Police say a southwest Missouri man who confessed to plotting to shoot up a screening of Twilight and a Walmart store had been detained after threatening a store clerk three years ago.
