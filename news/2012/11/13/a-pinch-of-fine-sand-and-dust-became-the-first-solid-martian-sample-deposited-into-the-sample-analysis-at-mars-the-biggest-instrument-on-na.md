# A pinch of fine sand and dust became the first solid Martian sample deposited into the Sample Analysis at Mars, the biggest instrument on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity. The sample came from the patch of windblown material called Rocknest, which had provided a sample previously for mineralogical analysis by CheMin instrument. 

A pinch of fine sand and dust became the first solid Martian sample deposited into the biggest instrument on NASA&#039;s Mars rover Curiosity: the Sample Analysis at Mars, or SAM.
