# Palestinian militants fire a barrage of rockets from Gaza into southern Israel, in a cross-border escalation following an earlier attack in which four Israeli soldiers are injured, two seriously, when an anti-tank missile fired from the Gaza Strip hits an Israeli army jeep patrolling some 200 meters inside the Israeli border with Gaza; Israel carries out counter-strikes, killing five Palestinians and wounding 30. 

More than 30 rockets fired from the Strip hours after terrorists injure four soldiers; &#8216;We will not let such border incidents go unanswered,&#8217; warns defense minister
