# U.S. Secretary of State Clinton notifies Congress of her intent to include the Haqqani network on the government's terror list. An attache at the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington dismisses the decision as an "internal matter" of the United States and reaffirms Pakistan's commitment to "combating extremism and terrorism." Haqqani senior commanders say the decision will not help in bringing peace to Afghanistan.
