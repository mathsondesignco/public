# 2012 Benghazi attack: Militiamen storm the US consulate in Benghazi. Reports indicate it has been burned down and looted. AFP reports a source saying rocket-propelled grenades were fired at the consulate. The U.S. Ambassador in Libya, J. Christopher Stevens, and three other people are killed. 

A US official is killed as Libyan militiamen storm the consulate in Benghazi, hours after a similar attack in Egypt over a US-produced film said to be insulting to the Prophet Muhammad.
