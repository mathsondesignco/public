# A police officer's claim that he witnessed a conflict outside Downing Street involving former British Conservative Party chief whip Andrew Mitchell is being probed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. CCTV footage of the incident also emerges, casting doubt on whether any witnesses were present at the time. 

The police watchdog says it is to investigate whether an officer did witness a row in which he claimed ex-Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell called officers &quot;plebs&quot;.
