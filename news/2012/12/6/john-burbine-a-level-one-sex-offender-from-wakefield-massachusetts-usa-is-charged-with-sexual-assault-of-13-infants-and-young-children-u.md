# John Burbine, a level one sex offender from Wakefield, Massachusetts (USA) is charged with Sexual assault of 13 infants and young children under his care. 

A convicted sex offender who provided home day-care services to unsuspecting families was indicted Thursday on charges of raping and abusing at least a dozen infants and children — a case prosecutors described as the most disturbing they had ever seen. John Burbine, a 49-year-old from Wakefield who worked in his wife’s child-care service, was accused of assaulting 13 infants and young children who were in his care, many of them repeatedly, over a two-year span beginning in August 2010.
