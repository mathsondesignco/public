# A Tupolev Tu-204 airliner with eight people on board crashes in a ditch between the airport fence and the M3 highway after overshooting a runway at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow, Russia, killing five people and leaving three others critically injured. 

At least four people die as a Russian plane overshoots the runway at a Moscow airport, breaking up and coming to rest on a main road.
