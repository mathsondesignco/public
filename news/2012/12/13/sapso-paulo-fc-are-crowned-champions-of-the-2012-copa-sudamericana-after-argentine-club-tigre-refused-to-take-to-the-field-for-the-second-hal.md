# Sao Paulo FC are crowned champions of the 2012 Copa Sudamericana after Argentine club Tigre refused to take to the field for the second half of the second leg in Brazil, claiming they were threatened at gunpoint by security officials at the Estadio do Morumbi, which was overlooked as a host stadium for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. 

An Argentine football club accuses Brazilian security officials of beating and pulling guns on its players during half time at a cup final in Sao Paulo.
