# Former President of Mexico Miguel de la Madrid dies of complications of lung disease in Mexico City at the age of 77. 

Miguel de la Madrid, who led Mexico between 1982 and 1988, helped open up the country economically and politically. His tenure was besmirched by Mexico&apos;s lingering financial troubles and a weak response to the catastrophic 1985 quake.
