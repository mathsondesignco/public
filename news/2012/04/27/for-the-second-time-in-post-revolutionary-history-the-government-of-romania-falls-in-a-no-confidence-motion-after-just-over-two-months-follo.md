# For the second time in post-revolutionary history the government of Romania falls in a no-confidence motion after just over two months following its appointment by the Parliament, while the Czech Republic government survived its confidence by just 12 votes. 

The two-month old government of Prime Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu fell in a no-confidence vote, joining a list of governments collapsing across Europe over austerity measures.
