# The annual report of the Jerusalem-based B'Tselem organisation states that in 2011, 105 Palestinians were killed by Israeli security forces in the Gaza Strip, 37 of whom are listed as non-combatants, and that Palestinian militants killed 11 Israeli civilians, among them a couple and three of their children murdered in their home. 

A human rights group has found a sharp rise in the number of civilians killed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
