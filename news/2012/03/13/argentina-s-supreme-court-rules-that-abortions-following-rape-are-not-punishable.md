# Argentina's Supreme Court rules that abortions following rape are not punishable. 

The Supreme Court has ratified today a ruling of a Chubut&rsquo;s court authorizing an abortion in the case of a woman that got pregnant after being raped. However, the head of the Supreme Court Ricardo Lorenzini emphasized that the ruling doesn&rsquo;t mean the start of possible abortion legalization. &nbsp;&nbsp;
