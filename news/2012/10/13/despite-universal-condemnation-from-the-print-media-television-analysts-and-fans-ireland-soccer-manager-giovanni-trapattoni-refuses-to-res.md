# Despite universal condemnation from the print media, television analysts and fans, Ireland soccer manager Giovanni Trapattoni refuses to resign following last night's humiliation at the hands of Germany in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group C. 

Giovanni Trapattoni&rsquo;s &pound;1.5 million-a-year contract as Republic of Ireland manager is likely to keep the Italian in his post for the remainder of the World Cup qualifiers, despite the ignominy of Friday&rsquo;s 6-1 defeat against Germany in Dublin.
