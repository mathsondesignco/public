# Occupy activists chain themselves to the pulpit of St Paul's Cathedral in an action of solidarity with Pussy Riot, and read a declaration calling on cathedral authorities to stop neglecting their Christian duty - "In the fight for economic justice, Jesus threw the money changers out of the temple, but you invited them in and instead evicted us." 

Protesters leave St Paul&#039;s after staging a protest in solidarity with Russian anarcho-punk band Pussy Riot.
