# Writer Javier Maras rejects the Spanish government's National Novel Prize, awarded for his novel "Los enamoramientos", saying "All my life I have managed to avoid state institutions, regardless of which party was in government, and I have turned down all income from the public purse. I don't want to be seen as an author who is favoured by any particular government."
