# Oil giant Shell is sued by Niger Delta farmers in a civil court in The Hague, claiming oil spills ruined their livelihoods. Shell says it is difficult to carry out repairs because of local insecurity. 

Oil giant Shell rejects claims that it should pay compensation to four Nigerian farmers, in a case that may set a legal precedent.
