# Syrian civil war:. Syrian opposition groups reject a UN-brokered peace plan accepted yesterday in Geneva for a political transition in Syria, arguing that it is ambiguous and a waste of time, and vowing not to negotiate with President Bashar Assad or members of his regime. 

Turkey scrambles six fighters after Syrian helicopters fly near the border, the army says, further raising tensions after a Turkish jet was downed last month.
