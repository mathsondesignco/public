# Pressure is raised in Hungary for authorities to arrest alleged former Nazi war criminal Laszlo Csatary, 97, who was discovered living in Hungary. Csatary is wanted in connection with his role in the deportation of Jews to death camps during the Second World War. 

Hungary is under pressure to prosecute the world&#039;s most wanted surviving Nazi war criminal after France demanded that &#039;there can be no immunity&#039; for those accused of carrying out the Holocaust.
