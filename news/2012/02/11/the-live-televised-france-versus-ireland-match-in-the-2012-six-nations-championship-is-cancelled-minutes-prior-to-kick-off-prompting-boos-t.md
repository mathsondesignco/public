# The live televised France versus Ireland match in the 2012 Six Nations Championship is cancelled minutes prior to kick-off, prompting boos to ring out among disgruntled spectators inside a packed Stade de France. It is the first time such an event has happened since 1985. 

The France versus Ireland Six Nations match was cancelled just minutes before kick-off because of a frozen pitch.
