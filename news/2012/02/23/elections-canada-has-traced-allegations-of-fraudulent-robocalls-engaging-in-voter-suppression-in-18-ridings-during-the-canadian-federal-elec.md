# Elections Canada has traced allegations of fraudulent robocalls engaging in voter suppression in 18 ridings during the Canadian federal election, 2011 to Racknine Inc., a small Edmonton call centre that worked for the Conservative Party of Canada party's national campaign. 

Opposition MPs have attacked the Conservatives over links to a company used to make fraudulent phone calls directing voters to the wrong polling stations in the last federal election.
