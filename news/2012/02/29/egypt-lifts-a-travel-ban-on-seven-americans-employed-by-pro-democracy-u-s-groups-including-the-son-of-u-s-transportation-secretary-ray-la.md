# Egypt lifts a travel ban on seven Americans employed by pro-democracy U.S. groups, including the son of U.S. Transportation secretary Ray LaHood, who is among 16 Americans on trial in Egypt for trying to foment unrest and incite protests against the nation's military rulers. 

The decision Wednesday appeared to signal the end of the worst crisis in relations between Egypt and the U.S. in 30 years.
