# 2011-2012 Syrian uprising:The United Nations Security Council votes on an Arab League proposal to resolve problems in Syria with reports of hundreds of people dead in the past couple of days as a result of shelling in Homs - the People's Republic of China and Russia veto the resolution. 

Syrian forces are accused of killing scores of people in Homs in one of the bloodiest nights in months, but the government denies it as the UN Security Council meets.
