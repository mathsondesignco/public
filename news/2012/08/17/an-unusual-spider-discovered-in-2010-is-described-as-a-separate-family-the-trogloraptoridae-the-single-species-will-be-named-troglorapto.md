# An unusual spider discovered in 2010 is described as a separate family, the Trogloraptoridae. The single species will be named ''Trogloraptor marchingtoni'', after Neil Marchington, a deputy sheriff, amateur biologist and local cave explorer who helped with the discovery. 

The newfound spider family is being named trogloraptor, meaning &quot;cave robber,&quot; and the single species found near Grants Pass is named Trogloraptor marchingtoni for Neil Marchington, a Deschutes County deputy sheriff who is also an amateur biologist and local cave explorer who helped lead the team of scientists to caves where the spiders were found. A report on the discovery by Griswold and his colleagues, graduate student Tracy Audisio of San Francisco State and postdoctoral researcher Joel Ledford of UC Davis, has been accepted for publication in ZooKeys, a peer-reviewed zoology journal. The adults are huge for any spider - about the size of a 50-cent piece - and they spin primitive webs with only a few strands, but hang beneath those webs from the cool, damp ceilings of the caves, Griswold said. Primitive relatives of other arachnid families may yet be discovered in the same regions, he noted, because many unique evolutionary descendants of other widespread groups live there, including coast redwoods, mountain beavers, coastal-tailed frogs, and some pseudoscorpions whose evolutionary ancestors date back 380 million years.
