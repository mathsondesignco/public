# The High Court of Australia upholds legislation providing for plain packaging of cigarettes. 

Australia&amp;#39;s High Court has upheld the world&amp;#39;s toughest laws on cigarette marketing, dismissing a legal challenge from tobacco companies in a major test case. Tobacco giants British American Tobacco, Britain&amp;#39;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the laws passed by parliament to ban logos and branding appearing on cigarette packages in Australia&amp;#39;s High Court. They said the new rules were unconstitutional because they infringed on their intellectual property rights. The seven judges did not agree and so from December 1 this year all cigarettes and tobacco products must be sold in plain olive green packets without branding. The packets will carry graphic health warnings.
