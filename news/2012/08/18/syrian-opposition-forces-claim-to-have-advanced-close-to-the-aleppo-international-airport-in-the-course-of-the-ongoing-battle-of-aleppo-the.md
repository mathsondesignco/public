# Syrian opposition forces claim to have advanced close to the Aleppo International Airport in the course of the ongoing Battle of Aleppo. The Syrian state media claim the attacks were repulsed. Heavy fighting is ongoing in Aleppo and Damascus. 

The insurgentsâ€™ seizure of areas near the airport comes as the United Nations and the Arab League announce that Lakhdar Brahimi, a veteran diplomat, will succeed Kofi Annan as the envoy to Syria.
