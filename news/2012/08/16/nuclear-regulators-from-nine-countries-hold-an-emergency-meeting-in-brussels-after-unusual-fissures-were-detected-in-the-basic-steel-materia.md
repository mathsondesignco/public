# Nuclear regulators from nine countries hold an emergency meeting in Brussels after unusual fissures were detected in the basic steel material of the Doel 3 pressurized water reactor vessel. This vessel type was built by now-defunct Rotterdam Drydocks with Krupp steel in 22 operating reactors worldwide, among which 10 in the US. Two 1 GW Belgian reactors will remain shut down at least until October.
