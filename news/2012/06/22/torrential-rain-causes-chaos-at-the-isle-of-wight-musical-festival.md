The pressure of preparing the new album and losing his drummer earlier this month has made it impossible to do the gig without massively compromising both the gig and the album. Apologies to all the fans, the organisers and the people of the Isle Of Wight"."[http://www.morrisseymusic.com/newsitem.asp?id=118]](/news/2005/05/27/popular-singer-morrissey-s-official-website-released-the-following-statement-morrissey-will-regrettably-not-be-appearing-at-the-isle-of.md) _Context: Isle of Wight musical festival_
