# News International phone hacking scandal: The House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee publishes its report into phone hacking at the ''News of the World''. The committee concludes that Rupert Murdoch "is not a fit person" to run a major international company and exhibited "wilful blindness" to phone-hacking and other practices going on in his media empire. The report also accuses three News Corporation executives of giving misleading evidence. 

Rupert Murdoch exhibited &quot;wilful blindness&quot; to what was going on in his media empire and &quot;is not a fit person to exercise the stewardship of a major international company&quot;, MPs say.
