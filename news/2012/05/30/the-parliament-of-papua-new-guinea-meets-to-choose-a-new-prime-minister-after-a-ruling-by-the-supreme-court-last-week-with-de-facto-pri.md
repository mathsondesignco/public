# The Parliament of Papua New Guinea meets to choose a new Prime Minister after a ruling by the Supreme Court last week, with ''de facto'' Prime Minister Peter O'Neill again chosen. 

Papua New Guinea&#039;s parliament is preparing to elect a new Prime Minister this morning, just a month before the country&#039;s general election. It comes after a dramatic u-turn by Peter O&#039;Neill&#039;s government, which now accepts Sir Michael Somare as PNG&#039;s legitimate leader.
