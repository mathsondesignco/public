# The combined economy of the 17 eurozone nations narrowly avoids a recession, largely due to relatively high economic growth in Germany. However, overall growth in the eurozone was zero in the first quarter of 2012. 

The eurozone avoided recession &ldquo;by the skin of its teeth&rdquo; as the latest GDP figures showed the growth was flat in the first quarter of 2012.
