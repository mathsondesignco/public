# An open letter from about 30 rabbi wives causes controversy due to its call for Israeli girls not to date Arabs or work in places that employ non-jews, three weeks after a similar letter urged Jews not to engage in property trade with non-Jews. 

A letter published by a group of rabbis in Israel has sparked calls for their dismissal.
