# Around 70 insurgents are killed when two NATO helicopters strike inside Pakistan in its northwest  Khost tribal area bordering Afghanistan. Pakistan strongly condemned the attack, calling it a violation of its airspace. 

Nato-led forces have killed more than 50 insurgents on Pakistani soil after a rare manned pursuit across the border from Afghanistan, officials say.
