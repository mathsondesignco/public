# Another group of asylum seekers starts a new protest at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in Sydney, Australia, while other detainees continue a hunger strike. 

Nine people, including a pregnant woman, have climbed on to the roof of a building at Sydney&#039;s Villawood detention centre, just hours after 11 other detainees ended their 30-hour protest on another roof.
