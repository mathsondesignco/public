# Remains of the first plane taken to Antarctica in 1912 are discovered by Australian researchers. 

Remains of the first plane taken to Antarctica, in 1912, have been found by Australian researchers. The Mawson&#039;s Huts Foundation had been searching for the plane, last seen in the mid-1970s, for three summers before stumbling on pieces of it on New Year&#039;s Day.
