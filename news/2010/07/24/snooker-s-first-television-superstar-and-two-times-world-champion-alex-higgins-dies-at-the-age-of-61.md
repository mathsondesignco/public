# Snooker's "first television superstar" and two-times world champion Alex Higgins dies at the age of 61. 

Alex Higgins&rsquo; contribution to snooker can be measured in many ways &ndash; but without him it is certainly possible that his two heirs as &lsquo;People&rsquo;s Champions&rsquo; &ndash; Jimmy White, and more recently Ronnie O&rsquo;Sullivan &ndash; would never have picked up a cue.
