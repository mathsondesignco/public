# Lesbian student Constance McMillen, banned by a high school in the United States from bringing her girlfriend to her leavers' dinner, is to receive a $35,000 settlement in response to a discrimination lawsuit. 

A school district which cancelled its prom rather than allow a lesbian student to attend with her girlfriend will pay damages to the student.
