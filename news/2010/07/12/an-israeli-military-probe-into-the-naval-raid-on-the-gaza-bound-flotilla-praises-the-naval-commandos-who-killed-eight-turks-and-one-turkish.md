# An Israeli military probe into the naval raid on the Gaza-bound flotilla praises the naval commandos who killed eight Turks and one Turkish-American but criticises poor Israeli intelligence that did not have a sufficient backup plan for its troops in the event that the Flotilla's passengers reacted violently to the raid. 

The killing of nine Turks in a raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla last month followed intelligence and planning &quot;mistakes&quot;, according to an Israel Defence Force (IDF)-commissioned report.
