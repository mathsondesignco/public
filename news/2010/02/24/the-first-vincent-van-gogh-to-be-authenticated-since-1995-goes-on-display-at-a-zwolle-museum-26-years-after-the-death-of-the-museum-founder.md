# The first Vincent van Gogh to be authenticated since 1995 goes on display at a Zwolle museum 26 years after the death of the museum founder who first identified it. 

A painting of a windmill newly attributed to the Dutch master Vincent Van Gogh went on display on Wednesday after spending decades in the depot of a Dutch provincial museum.
