# Cuban President Raul Castro "laments" the death of political prisoner Orlando Zapata, who was on a hunger strike for more than 80 days in protest of prison conditions in the country. 

The hunger strike death of a Cuban political prisoner provoked international condemnation on Wednesday and regrets from Cuban President Raul Castro, though he suggested the United States was to blame.
