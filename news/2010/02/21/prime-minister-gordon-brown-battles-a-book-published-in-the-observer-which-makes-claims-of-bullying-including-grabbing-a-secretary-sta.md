# Prime Minister Gordon Brown battles a book published in ''The Observer'' which makes claims of bullying, including grabbing a secretary, stabbing with a pen and shouting expletives as members of his own staff contact the National Bullying Helpline to express their "concerns". 

A number of Downing Street staff have called an anti-bullying hotline, according to the head of a charity who criticised Gordon Brown for his handling of the situation.
