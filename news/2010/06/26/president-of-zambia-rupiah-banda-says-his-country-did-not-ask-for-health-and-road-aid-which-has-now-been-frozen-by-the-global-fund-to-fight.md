# President of Zambia Rupiah Banda says his country did not ask for health and road aid which has now been frozen by The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the European Union before an upcoming election and says "We must not allow donors to feel they can interfere in the internal affairs of this country because it is a sovereign and independent state".
