# Hope for the dozens of Colombian coal miners trapped underground yesterday begins to fade. At least 50 miners are estimated to still be trapped 2 kilometers underground, all of whom are thought to be dead. Rescue workers have so far recovered 18 bodies, and have advanced 700 meters underground. 

Rescuers in Colombia resume work to free dozens of miners trapped underground, but there is little hope any have survived.
