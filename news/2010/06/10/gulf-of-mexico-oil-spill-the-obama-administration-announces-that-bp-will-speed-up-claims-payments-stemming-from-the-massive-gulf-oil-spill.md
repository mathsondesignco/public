# Gulf of Mexico oil spill:: The Obama administration announces that BP will speed up claims payments stemming from the massive Gulf oil spill, to fishermen, property owners and businesspeople who have filed damage claims and are complaining of delays, excessive paperwork and inadequate compensation. 

British Petroleum said Thursday it plans to increase its ability to capture the oil gushing from a leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico by early next week. Meanwhile, the White House announced that the company agreed to speed up claims payments.
