# Riots erupt in the southern city of Osh killing at least 45, and injuring over a hundred others. The violence comes just over two months after violent riots in Bishkek toppled Kurmanbek Bakiyev's government, and only days ahead of a critical constitutional referendum. 

Thousands flee homes in southern region as ethnic unrest leaves more than 600 wounded.
