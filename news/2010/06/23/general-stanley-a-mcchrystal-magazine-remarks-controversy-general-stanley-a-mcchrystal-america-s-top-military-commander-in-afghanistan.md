# General Stanley A. McChrystal magazine remarks controversy:. General Stanley A. McChrystal, America's top military commander in Afghanistan, submits his resignation after being summoned home by an "angry" Barack Obama due to his expression of critical opinions about senior American politicians and diplomats in a "Rolling Stone" magazine profile. Afghan President Hamid Karzai supports McChrystal, while the Taliban say the incident is "another sign of the start of the political defeat" for America's Afghan policies. 

An article on the top US general in Afghanistan was an &quot;enormous mistake&quot; and has angered the president, the White House says.
