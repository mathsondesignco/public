# There is a further cave-in at the mine near Copiapo, Chile where people have been working since Thursday to rescue 34 miners trapped underground; work is currently suspended in an incident that is rare in that part of the world. 

Rescuers in Chile start drilling holes to provide 33 trapped miners with oxygen after a cave-in blocks a rescue attempt.
