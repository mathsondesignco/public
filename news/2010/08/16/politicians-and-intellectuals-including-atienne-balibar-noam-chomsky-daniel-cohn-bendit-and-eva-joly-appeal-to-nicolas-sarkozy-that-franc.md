# Politicians and intellectuals including Etienne Balibar, Noam Chomsky, Daniel Cohn-Bendit and Eva Joly appeal to Nicolas Sarkozy that France repay -17 billion it took from Haiti in 1825 after the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804); they say the money is "morally, economically, and legally unassailable" in the aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake. 

A group of intellectuals and politicians calls on France to repay 17bn euros (Â£14bn) &quot;extorted&quot; from Haiti in the 19th Century.
