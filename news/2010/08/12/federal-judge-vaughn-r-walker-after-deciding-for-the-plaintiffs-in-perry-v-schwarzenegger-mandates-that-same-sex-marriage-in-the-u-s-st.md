# Federal Judge Vaughn R. Walker, after deciding for the plaintiffs in Perry v. Schwarzenegger, mandates that same-sex marriage in the U.S. state of California should resume on August 18. 

A federal district judge lifted a stay on his decision on same-sex marriage, but he delayed implementation of the order until Aug. 18.
