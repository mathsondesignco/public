# Hungarian actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, hospitalised after falling in the United States last month, is not released from hospital as had been initially expected due to a negative reaction to her morphine. 

Zsa Zsa Gabor was not released from hospital on Saturday as expected after going into shock, her publicist says.
