# At least 25 or 32 Afghans, including civilians, are killed by NATO airstrikes in Nangarhar Province, many bombed by NATO planes while attending the funeral of a flood victim; relatives are displeased. 

Nato air strikes are said to have killed at least 25 Afghans, hours after US troops are urged to avoid hurting non-combatants.
