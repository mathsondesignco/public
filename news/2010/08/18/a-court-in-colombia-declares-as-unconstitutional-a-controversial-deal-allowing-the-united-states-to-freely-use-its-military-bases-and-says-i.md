# A court in Colombia declares as unconstitutional a controversial deal allowing the United States to freely use its military bases and says it will have to be redrafted; other Latin American countries have expressed concern that the United States is exerting excessive influence on the region. 

A Colombia court rules a 2009 deal allowing US troops access to army bases is unconstitutional and needs congressional approval.
