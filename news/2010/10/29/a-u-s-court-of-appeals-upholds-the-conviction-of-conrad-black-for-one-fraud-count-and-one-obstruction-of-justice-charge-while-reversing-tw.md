# A U.S. Court of Appeals upholds the conviction of Conrad Black for one fraud count and one obstruction-of-justice charge, while reversing two other fraud counts on the basis of a Supreme Court decision last year. 

Conrad Black faces the prospect of heading back to jail after a U.S. appeal court upheld two of four criminal charges against him.
