# 3 drone strikes kill 18 people in the Data Khel area of North Waziristan in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Area as the government continues to block a NATO supply route into Afghanistan, bringing the numbers of militant and civilian deaths to at least 150. 

Nine suspected militants are killed in two US drone attacks, amid tensions between Pakistan and Nato over a cross-border assault on Thursday.
