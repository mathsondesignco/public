# The number of mortgage foreclosures in the United States in September 2010 exceeds 100,000 for the first time. 

The number of homes taken over by banks topped 100,000 for the first time in September, though foreclosures are expected to slow in coming months as lenders work through questionable paperwork, real estate data company RealtyTrac said on Thursday.
