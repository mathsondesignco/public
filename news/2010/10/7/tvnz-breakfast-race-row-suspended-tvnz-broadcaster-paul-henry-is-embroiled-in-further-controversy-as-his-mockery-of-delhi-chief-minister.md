# TVNZ "Breakfast" race row:. Suspended TVNZ broadcaster Paul Henry is embroiled in further controversy as his mockery of Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit is declared "racist" and "unacceptable" and New Zealand's ambassador to India is summoned for a dressing down. 

India denounced Thursday &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot; remarks made by a New Zealand television anchor about an Indian minister and summoned the country&#039;s ambassador to present a complaint.
