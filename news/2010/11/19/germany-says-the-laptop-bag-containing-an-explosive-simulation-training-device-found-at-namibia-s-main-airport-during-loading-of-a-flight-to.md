# Germany says the laptop bag containing an explosive simulation training device found at Namibia's main airport during loading of a flight to Munich was part of a security test, a day after German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere issued a warning of possible terror attacks next week. 

A dummy bomb that sparked an international terror alert was made by an 80-year-old Calif. grandmother and was discarded in an Namibia airport because of &quot;a boo boo,&quot; NBC reported.
