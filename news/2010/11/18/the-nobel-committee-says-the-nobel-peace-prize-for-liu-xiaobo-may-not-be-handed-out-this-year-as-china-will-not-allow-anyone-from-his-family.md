# The Nobel Committee says the Nobel Peace Prize for Liu Xiaobo may not be handed out this year as China will not allow anyone from his family to attend the event. 

The presentation in Oslo next month will most likely be postponed because China is not allowing the dissident Liu Xiaobo or his family to attend.
