# Israel's parliament passes a bill requiring a special parliamentary majority or a referendum before Israel could relinquish the Golan Heights or east Jerusalem for a peace deal. 

Bill approved by vote of 65-33 now requires either Knesset super-majority or a national referendum in order to hand over any annexed territories.
