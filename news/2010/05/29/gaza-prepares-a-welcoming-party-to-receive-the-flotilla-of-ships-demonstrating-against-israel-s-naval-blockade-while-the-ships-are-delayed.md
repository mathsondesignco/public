# Gaza prepares a welcoming party to receive the flotilla of ships demonstrating against Israel's naval blockade, while the ships are delayed near Cyprus due to unsuccessful attempts to collect dozens of high-profile supporters from the island. 

Ships carrying 10,000 tonnes of supplies and hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists to blockaded Gaza are being held up near Cyprus.
