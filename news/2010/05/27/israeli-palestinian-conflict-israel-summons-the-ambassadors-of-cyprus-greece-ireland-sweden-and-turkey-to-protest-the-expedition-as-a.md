# Israeli-Palestinian conflict:: Israel summons the ambassadors of Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Sweden and Turkey to protest the expedition as an unnecessary provocation after eight ships, including four cargo vessels and a Turkish passenger ferry carrying 600 people, including a Nobel peace laureate and former U.S. congresswoman, set sail for Gaza with 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid to break a three-year Israeli blockade on the territory. 

Pro-Palestinian activists have vowed to break through the Israeli blockade of Gaza, as a convoy of aid ships departed despite Israeli warnings it would be stopped.
