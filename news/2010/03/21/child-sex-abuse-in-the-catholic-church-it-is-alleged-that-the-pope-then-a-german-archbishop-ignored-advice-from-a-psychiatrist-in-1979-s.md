# Child sex abuse in the Catholic Church:. It is alleged that the Pope (then a German archbishop) ignored advice from a psychiatrist in 1979 stating Father Peter "Hulli" Hullermann was "untreatable" and "must never be allowed to work with children again". 

An Australian victims group says the Pope should apologise to abuse victims in Australia, as well as people who were abused by priests in Ireland.
