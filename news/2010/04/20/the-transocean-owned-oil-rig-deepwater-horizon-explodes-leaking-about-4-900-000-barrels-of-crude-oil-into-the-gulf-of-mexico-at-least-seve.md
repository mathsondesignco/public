# The Transocean-owned oil rig Deepwater Horizon explodes, leaking about 4,900,000 barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. At least seven people were injured and over a dozen were missing at sea. 

The oil rig that exploded and then sank 36 hours later could lead to a major oil spill, officials say, and as a result a remotely operated vehicle is surveying the seas and cleanup assets are in place.
