# The Islamic State of Iraq posts a statement on the internet claiming responsibility for Sunday's triple bombings in Baghdad which killed at least 40 people and affected some foreign embassies but denies involvement in Tuesday's six bombings which killed 35 people in Shia areas. 

A militant group linked to al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for suicide car bombings aimed at embassies in Iraq which killed 41 people, a group that monitors insurgent communications said.
