# July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike WikiLeaks video controversy:Fox News alleges "many who have viewed the video" WikiLeaks released recently showing American forces killing civilians in a July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike have accused the website of "selectively editing" (by slowing down selected parts of it) after a report by The Pentagon was released claiming that several of those killed did have weapons. 

WikiLeaks, the self-proclaimed whistle-blowing investigative Web site, released a classified military video Monday that it says shows the indiscriminate slaying of innocent Iraqis. Two days later, questions linger about just how much of the story WikiLeaks decided to tell.
