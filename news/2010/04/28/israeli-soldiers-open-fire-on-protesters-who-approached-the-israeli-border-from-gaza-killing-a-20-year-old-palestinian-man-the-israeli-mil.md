# Israeli soldiers open fire on protesters who approached the Israeli border from Gaza, killing a 20-year-old Palestinian man. The Israeli military says the demonstrators were throwing stones at soldiers and setting fires. 

A Palestinian demonstrator was shot dead and at least four other men died in a tunnel after the Egyptian authorities blew up another tunnel nearby, officials said.
