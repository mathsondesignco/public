# Pope Benedict XVI and his upcoming visit to Britain:The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office apologises after ''The Sunday Telegraph'' obtains a "foolish" document calling for the upcoming September visit of Pope Benedict XVI to be marked by the launch of "Benedict-branded" condoms, the opening of an abortion clinic and the blessing of a same-sex marriage. 

Britain&#39;s Foreign Office has apologised for a memo by a civil servant suggesting Pope Benedict should open a hospital abortion ward when he visits the country later this year.
