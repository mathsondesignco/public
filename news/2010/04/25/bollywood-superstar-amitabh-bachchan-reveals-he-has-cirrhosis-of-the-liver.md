# Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan reveals he has cirrhosis of the liver. 

Mikey Bustos has &quot;a couple million or so,&quot; he says, the result of his growing popularity on YouTube (by the way, the real number is over 47 million!). His parodies, covers, and his impressive handling of a 10-part acappella rendition of &quot;Wake Me Up&quot; by Avicii have only expanded on the love he got from fans of Canadian Idol, where he was one of the runners-up in 2003.
