# Syrian rebels launch new offensives against government forces in the country's Latakia Governorate and Hama Governorate. Several rebel groups earlier announced they were launching a new battle against government forces in response to claimed violations of the cease-fire agreement, further putting a strain on the Syrian peace process. 

Rockets fired from northern Syria have killed four Syrians - three of them children - in the Turkish border town of Kilis, local officials say.
