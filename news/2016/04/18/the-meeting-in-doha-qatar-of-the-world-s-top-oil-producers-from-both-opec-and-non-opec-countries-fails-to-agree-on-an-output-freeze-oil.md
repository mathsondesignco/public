# The meeting in Doha, Qatar, of the world's top oil producers, from both OPEC and non-OPEC countries, fails to agree on an output freeze. Oil analysts say the failure was due to Iran's non-participation, and Saudi Arabia linking its cooperation to Iran's inclusion. Oil prices drop in early Asian trading and on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 

As the Doha meeting looms it appears that the chances of a meaningful outcome are slim, and if there is no agreement whatsoever, then investors can expect a sharp selloff
