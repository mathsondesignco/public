# North Korea and weapons of mass destruction. According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, North Korea appears to be preparing a test-launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile. This comes after what the United States described as the "fiery, catastrophic" failure of the first attempt a few days prior. 

The United States warned on Tuesday it would consider &quot;other&quot; options, which could include new sanctions or security steps, if North Korea continued nuclear and ballistic missile testing.
