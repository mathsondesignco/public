# A large explosion is reported in the Afghan capital Kabul a week after the Taliban declared the start of their annual spring offensive. The target was an Afghan government security compound with at least 28 people reported killed and more than 200 others injured. 

A loud explosion rocked central Kabul early on Tuesday during rush hour, and a thick plume of black smoke could be seen rising from the vicinity of the sprawling US embassy in the Afghan capital, witnesses told Reuters. No casualties were reported.
