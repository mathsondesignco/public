# The 2016 United States women's college basketball national championship will be decided when two former Big East Conference foes meet at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis at 8:30 p.m. EDT, Tuesday, April 5, 2016. Connecticut topped Oregon State 80-51, and Syracuse claimed an 80-59 win over Washington in Sunday's semifinals. Syracuse (30-7, 13-3 ACC) will be making its first appearance in the NCAA title game. UConn (37-0, 18-0 American), a 10-time national champion and defending champion for the fourth straight season, has won every title game it has played in. 

Breanna Stewart had a slow start and UConn lost Katie Lou Samuelson to injury. But it was business as usual for Morgan Tuck, who led the Huskies to the title game with 21 points.
