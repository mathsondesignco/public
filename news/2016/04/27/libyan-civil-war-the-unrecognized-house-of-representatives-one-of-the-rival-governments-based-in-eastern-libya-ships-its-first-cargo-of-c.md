# Libyan Civil War. The unrecognized House of Representatives, one of the rival governments based in eastern Libya, ships its first cargo of crude oil in defiance of the U.N.-backed authorities in the capital Tripoli in a move that could deepen divisions within the country. The Tripoli-based government asked the United Nations Security Council yesterday to blacklist the tanker. 

UN-backed authorities in Tripoli call for international help to apprehend the tanker Distya Ameya which made off with 650,000 barrels of crude
