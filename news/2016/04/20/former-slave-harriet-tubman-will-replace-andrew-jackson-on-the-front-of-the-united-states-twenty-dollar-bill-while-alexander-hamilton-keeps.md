# Former slave Harriet Tubman will replace Andrew Jackson on the front of the United States twenty-dollar bill while Alexander Hamilton keeps his place on the ten after the public consultation process. 

Anti-slavery crusader Harriet Tubman will become the first African-American on the face of U.S. paper currency, and the first woman in more than a century, when she replaces former President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill.
