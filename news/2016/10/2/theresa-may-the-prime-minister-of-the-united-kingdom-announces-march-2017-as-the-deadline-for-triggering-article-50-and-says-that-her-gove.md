# Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, announces March 2017 as the deadline for triggering Article 50 and says that her government will introduce a "Great Repeal Bill" that will repeal the European Communities Act 1972 once the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. 

Theresa May says she will trigger Brexit by the end of March, telling the Tory party conference it is time to strike a deal with the EU as an independent, sovereign UK.
