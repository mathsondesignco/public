# Computer security firm Symantec warns a second hacking group, going by the name Odinaff, is trying to rob banks using fraudulent SWIFT messages, the same approach that yielded U.S.$81 million in February's attack on Bangladesh's central bank. So far, the group has infected 10 to 20 organizations with this  malware. 

Symantec&#039;s latest research on Odinaff hacker group and its attacks on SWIFT users indicates a surge in cybercrime against financial institutions.
