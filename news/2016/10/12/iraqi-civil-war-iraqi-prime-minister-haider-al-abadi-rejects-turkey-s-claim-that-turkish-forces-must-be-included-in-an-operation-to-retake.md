# Iraqi Civil War. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi rejects Turkey's claim that Turkish forces must be included in an operation to retake the militant-held city of Mosul. 

Turkey-Iraq relations became strained after Ankara sent troops late last year to the region of Bashiqa, northeast of Mosul, to train anti-IS fighters there â€” a move Baghdad has since labeled a &#034;blatant violation&#034; of its sovereignty.
