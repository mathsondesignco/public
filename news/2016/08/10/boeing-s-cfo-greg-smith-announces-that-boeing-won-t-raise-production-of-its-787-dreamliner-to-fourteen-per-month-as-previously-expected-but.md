# Boeing's CFO Greg Smith announces that Boeing won't raise production of its 787 Dreamliner to fourteen per month as previously expected, but will keep it at 12 while continuing to monitor demand. 

Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Wednesday it will not increase 787 output and could further cut 777 output unless sales of both jets improve, its clearest indication yet that its production of large jetliners may have peaked for now.
