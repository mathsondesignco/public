# The American town of Shishmaref, Alaska, votes to relocate the village from its current location on a barrier island, that has been disappearing through erosion and rising sea levels, to a site on the mainland. 

Residents voted to move Shishmaref from a barrier island that has been disappearing because of erosion and flooding attributed to global warming.
