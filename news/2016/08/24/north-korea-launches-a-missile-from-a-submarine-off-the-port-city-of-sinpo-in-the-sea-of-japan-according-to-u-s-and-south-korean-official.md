#  North Korea launches a missile from a submarine off the port city of Sinpo in the Sea of Japan, according to U.S. and South Korean officials. This missile, the third sub-based attempt this year, flew about 500 kilometers (311 miles) and landed in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The first test exploded and the second traveled 30 km (181/2 miles). 

It&#x27;s the third submarine-launched missile test fired this year, but the other tests either exploded in mid-air or only traveled a short distance.
