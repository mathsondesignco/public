# Russia-United States relations: Russia's Foreign Ministry warns of "retaliatory measures" over the entry of the United States Navy destroyer, USS "Porter". The USS "Porter" arrived in the Black Sea port of Varna, Bulgaria, earlier this week for what the U.S. Navy called a routine deployment. 

Moscow objects to beefed-up U.S. presence on the eve of a NATO summit in Poland.
