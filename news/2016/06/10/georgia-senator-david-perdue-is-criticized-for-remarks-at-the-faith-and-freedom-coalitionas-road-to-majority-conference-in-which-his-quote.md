# Georgia Senator David Perdue is criticized for remarks at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority conference in which his quote of Psalm 109:8, "Let his days be few, and may another have his office," appears to be a prayer for President Barack Obama's death. Perdue says, "It was a little humor and I said it in a way that we were talking about his days as president." 

Georgia Sen. David Perdue said people should pray for President Barack Obama, then recited a Bible verse about death, praying &quot;let his days be few.&quot;
