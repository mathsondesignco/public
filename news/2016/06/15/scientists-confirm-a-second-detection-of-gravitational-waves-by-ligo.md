The signal beam, detected on 4 January 2017, apparently results from a merger of two black holes of 19 and 31 solar masses. Such detections are said to be progressively moving this emerging field in astronomy "from novelty to new observational science". ](/news/2017/06/1/scientists-announce-that-the-advanced-laser-interferometer-gravitational-wave-observatory-ligo-has-made-a-third-detection-of-gravitational.md) _Context: LIGO_
