# Scientists report, in the AHA journal "Stroke", that a small trial of stroke victims showed significant improvement following injection of stem cells directly into their brains. The study had been designed just to test whether the highly experimental therapy was safe. Such treatments were available in China for many years but treatment results were very inconclusive. 

The results could be a fluke, but the research is encouraging.
