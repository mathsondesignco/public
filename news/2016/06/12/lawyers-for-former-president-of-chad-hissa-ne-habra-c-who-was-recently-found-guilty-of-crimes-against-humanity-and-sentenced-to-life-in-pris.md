# Lawyers for former President of Chad Hissene Habre, who was recently found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life in prison, appeal the verdict. However, a tribunal spokesman said the appeal process is not expected to be done before April 2017. 

Former military ruler Hissene Habre was jailed for crimes against humanity last month by a special court in Senegal.
