# European Union leaders advise the United Kingdom that, after their EU exit, to retain access to the bloc's lucrative single market, the UK must allow free movement for EU workers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande reiterated that freedom of movement of EU citizens is non-negotiable. 

There can be no pick and choose in the single market, EU leaders meeting in Brussels say, after discussing the UK vote to leave.
