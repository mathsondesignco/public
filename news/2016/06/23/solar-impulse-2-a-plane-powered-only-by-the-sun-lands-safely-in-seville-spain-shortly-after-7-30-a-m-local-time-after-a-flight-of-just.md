# Solar Impulse 2, a plane powered only by the sun, lands safely in  Seville, Spain, shortly after 7.30 a.m. local time after a flight of just over 71 hours.   The 15th leg of the round-the-world journey  had been expected to take up to 90 hours. 

An airplane powered solely by the sun landed safely in Seville in Spain early on Thursday after an almost three-day flight across the Atlantic from New York in one of the longest legs of the first ever fuel-less flight around the world.
