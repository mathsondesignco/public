# An international team of scientists report in the journal "Nature Communications" the discovery of a material (SBMOF-1) that can clear nuclear waste gases, produced by reprocessing plants, more efficiently, cheaply, and safely than currently available methods. 

This material that can clear out radioactive waste from nuclear plants more efficiently, cheaply, and safely than current methods.
