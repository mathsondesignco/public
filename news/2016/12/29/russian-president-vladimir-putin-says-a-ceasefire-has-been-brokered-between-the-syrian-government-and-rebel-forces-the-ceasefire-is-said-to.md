# Russian president Vladimir Putin says a ceasefire has been brokered between the Syrian government and rebel forces. The ceasefire is said to be guaranteed by Russia and Turkey and would exclude UN-denominated terror organizations such as ISIL and al-Nusra. The FSA says it would abide by the truce, while Ahrar al-Sham expresses "reservations". 

The United Nations has adopted a resolution supporting efforts by Russia and Turkey to end violence in Syria and start peace negotiations. Russia and Turkey announced the ceasefire this week, the third truce this year seeking to end the nearly six years of war in Syria. Peace talks between President Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s government and rebel forces in Syria are set to take place next year in Kazakhstan.
