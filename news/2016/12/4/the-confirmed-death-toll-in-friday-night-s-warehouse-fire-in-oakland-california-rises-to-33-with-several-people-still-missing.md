# The confirmed death toll in Friday night's warehouse fire in Oakland, California rises to 33 with several people still missing. 

&#x27;That is an astronomical number,&#x27; said Alameda County Sheriff&#x27;s Sgt. Ray Kelly. &#x27;We&#x27;re really starting to get deeper into the building and as we do that we continue to find more victims.&#x27;
