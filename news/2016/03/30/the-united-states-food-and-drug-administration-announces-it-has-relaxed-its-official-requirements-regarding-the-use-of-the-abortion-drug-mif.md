# The United States Food and Drug Administration announces it has relaxed its official requirements regarding the use of the abortion drug Mifeprex (RU-486). The current guidelines were based on 1990s medical evidence. Changes include reducing the number of physician visits required by abortion-seeking women, reducing drug dosage, and allowing women to take the drug for three weeks longer -- now a total of 70 days. 

The FDA said Wednesday it has relaxed its official requirements for the use of the abortion drug Mifeprex, which were based on outdated 1990s medical evidence.
