# Belgian federal prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw  says two brothers of Belgian nationality, Khalid and Brahim el-Bakraoui, were responsible for yesterday's suicide bombings. Khalid bombed the subway station while Ibrahim bombed the airport, he added. A third suspect, who died at the airport, is identified as Najim Laachraoui, says ''De Standaard''. A fourth suspect seen in the airport photo, who left a massive bomb at the airport that did not detonate, is unidentified and still at large. 

The brothers fit what European anti-terrorism investigators call a disturbing but now-familiar profile.
