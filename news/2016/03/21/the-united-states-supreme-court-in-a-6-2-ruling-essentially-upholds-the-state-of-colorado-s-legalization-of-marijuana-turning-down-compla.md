# The United States Supreme Court, in a 6-2 ruling, essentially upholds the state of Colorado's legalization of marijuana, turning down complaints by the neighboring states of Nebraska and Oklahoma that, by federal and their state law, Colorado's statutes  allow "illegal marijuana" to pour into their states. Last year, the justices  asked the federal government to weigh in; in December, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr.  urged the court to turn away the lawsuit. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. 

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a conservative challenge to the marijuana legalization laws adopted in Colorado and elsewhere that permit adults to buy, sell or use an ounce of the drug. By a 6-2 vote, the justices turned away a lawsuit brought by Nebraska and Oklahoma, whose state attorneys complained that illegal marijuana was pouring into their states as a result of Colorado’s liberalized laws. Since California’s voters in 1996 authorized medical use of marijuana, 22 other states have adopted similar measures. Faced with this state-by-state rebellion against an unchanging federal drug law, the Justice Department issued guidance telling prosecutors to focus on “significant traffickers of illegal drugs,” not on users of medical marijuana. Last year, the justices asked U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli to weigh in on the interstate legal battle over marijuana, and in December, he urged the court to turn away the lawsuit. “Nebraska and Oklahoma essentially contend,” he wrote, that Colorado’s authorization of licensed intrastate marijuana production and distribution increases the likelihood that third parties will commit criminal offenses in Nebraska and Oklahoma by bringing marijuana purchased from licensed entities in Colorado into those states.
