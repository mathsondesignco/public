# Five U.S. women's national soccer team players file federal wage discrimination complaints with the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF). In the filing, the players cite 2015 USSF figures which show they were paid nearly four times less than men's players despite generating nearly $20 million more revenue. A U.S. Soccer statement says, "... we are disappointed about this action."  

&quot;The pay disparity between men and women is just too large,&quot; Carli Lloyd says.
