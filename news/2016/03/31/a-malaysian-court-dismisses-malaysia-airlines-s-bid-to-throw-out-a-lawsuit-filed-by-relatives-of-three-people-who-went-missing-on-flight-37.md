# A Malaysian court dismisses  Malaysia Airlines's bid to throw out a lawsuit filed by relatives of three people who went missing on Flight 370. The company argued that the disappearance of MH370 on March 8, 2014, occurred before the company came into existence as Malaysia Airlines Berhad (MAB) on September 1, 2015, and therefore  has no liability to relatives. The court ruled  MAB's liability would be determined in a trial. 

A court in Malaysia has rejected a bid by Malaysia Airlines to throw out a lawsuit filed by the relatives of three people who went missing on Flight 370.
