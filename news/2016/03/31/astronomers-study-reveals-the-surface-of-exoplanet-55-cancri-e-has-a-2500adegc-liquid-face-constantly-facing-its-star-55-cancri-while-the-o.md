# Astronomers' study reveals the surface of exoplanet 55 Cancri e has a 2500degC liquid face, constantly facing its star 55 Cancri, while the other side is relatively colder and solid. 

For the first time, astronomers map a nearby &quot;super-Earth&quot; exoplanet called 55 Cancri e to find that one hemisphere is almost completely molten rock, while the other half is almost completely solid.
