# The Obama administration announces it is cancelling plans to permit drilling for oil and gas off the southeastern U.S. Atlantic coast. A new plan involves 10 potential lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and three off the coast of Alaska. 

The Obama administration abandons plans to allow new offshore oil drilling on the U.S. southeast coast, dealing a blow to companies that had hopes of tapping new reserves.
