# The Ferguson, Missouri, city council, after last month voting to change the terms of the agreement, reverses course and unanimously (6-0) agrees to accept a U.S. Justice Department overhaul of its troubled police force and municipal courts.  This avoided a likely expensive legal battle with the federal government which had filed suit against the city following last month's vote.
