# The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff and a U.S. defense official report that North Korea fired two ballistic missiles from the South Pyongan Province. One flew 800 kilometers (497 miles) into the Sea of Japan. The other disappeared at an altitude of about 17 kilometers (10.5 miles). 

Pyongyang launches what appears to be two medium-range ballistic missiles weeks after being hit with tough new sanctions.
