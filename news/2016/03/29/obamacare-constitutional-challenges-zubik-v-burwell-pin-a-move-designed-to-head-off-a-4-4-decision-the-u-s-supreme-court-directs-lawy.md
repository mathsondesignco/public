# Obamacare constitutional challenges, ''Zubik v. Burwell''In a move designed to head off a 4-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court directs lawyers for the Obama administration, and for the religious groups who challenge it, to submit written briefs on a possible remedy to the case: whether coverage could be provided through the group's insurance companies without any actual notice to the government. A 4-4 decision would not set a national precedent, and would let stand the preceding decision in each case. In these seven cases, the appeals court in six upheld the government mandate. 

The U.S. Supreme Court today asked new questions in one of the term&#x27;s most contentious cases, involving the contraceptive requirements of Obamacare.
