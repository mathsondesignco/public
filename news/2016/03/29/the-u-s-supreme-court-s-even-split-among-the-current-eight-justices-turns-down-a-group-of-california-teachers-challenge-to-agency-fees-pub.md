# The U.S. Supreme Court's even split among the current eight justices turns down a group of California teachers' challenge to agency fees public sector unions representing government employees charge employees for collective bargaining costs, whether or not they choose to join the union. Twenty-four other states and the District of Columbia have a similar provision. The ninth circuit federal appellate court ruling in the union-s favor stands. Employees challenging the law may bring the appeal again, once the vacancy on the nation-s highest court is filled. 

WASHINGTON – An even split among the current eight justices of the U.S. Supreme Court today gave a victory to public unions in a case that seemed destined to deal a major blow to public sector unions’ throughout the country, including the Bay State.
