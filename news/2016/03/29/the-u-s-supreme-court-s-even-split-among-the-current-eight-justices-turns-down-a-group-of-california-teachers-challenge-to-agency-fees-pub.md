# The U.S. Supreme Court's even split among the current eight justices turns down a group of California teachers' challenge to agency fees public sector unions representing government employees charge employees for collective bargaining costs, whether or not they choose to join the union. Twenty-four other states and the District of Columbia have a similar provision. The ninth circuit federal appellate court ruling in the union's favor stands. Employees challenging the law may bring the appeal again, once the vacancy on the nation's highest court is filled. 

WASHINGTON – An even split among the current eight justices of the U.S. Supreme Court today gave a victory to public unions in a case that seemed destined to deal a major blow to public sector unions’ throughout the country, including the Bay State.
