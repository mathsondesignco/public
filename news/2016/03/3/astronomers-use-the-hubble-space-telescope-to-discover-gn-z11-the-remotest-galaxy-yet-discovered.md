This confirms the theory according to which neutron star mergers are the cause of at least some short gamma-ray bursts. ](/news/2017/10/16/scientists-announce-that-the-ligo-and-virgo-gravitational-wave-observatories-detected-for-the-first-time-gravitational-waves-from-the-merger.md) _Context: Hubble space telescope_
