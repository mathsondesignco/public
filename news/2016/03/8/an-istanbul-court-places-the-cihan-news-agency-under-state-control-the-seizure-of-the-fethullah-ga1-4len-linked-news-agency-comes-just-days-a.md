# An Istanbul court places the Cihan News Agency under state control. The seizure of the Fethullah Gulen-linked news agency comes just days after the Turkish government seized control of the opposition ''Zaman'' newspaper. 

Turkish authorities have seized control of the Cihan news agency, the agency said, widening the crackdown against supporters of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, an influential foe of President Tayyip Erdogan.
