# A Pew Research Center survey of Jewish and non-Jewish Israelis, via face-to-face interviews from October 2014 through May 2015, finds deep divisions in Israeli society - not only between Israeli Jews and the country's Arab citizen minority, but also among the religious subgroups that make up Israeli Jewry.  An overwhelming majority (98%) of Israeli Jews agree all Jews should have the right to  move to Israel and receive immediate citizenship. Close to half (48 percent)  support the expulsion or transfer of Arabs from Israel, yet most secular Jews  disagree (58%) with this, as do 54 percent of those in the center politically (more so from the left). Meanwhile, Israeli Arabs,  currently about one-in-five of the country's adults, generally do not think Israel can be a Jewish state and a democracy at the same time. Fewer  Arabs (down 24 points) think a peaceful, two-state solution is possible, from 74% in 2013 to 50% now. Both groups are skeptical of the peace process: Israeli Arabs question the sincerity of the Israeli government in seeking a peace agreement, while Israeli Jews are equally skeptical about the sincerity of Palestinian leaders. (Pew is a non-partisan American think tank based in Washington, D.C.) 

There are deep divisions in Israeli society over political values and religion&#039;s role in public life -- not only between Jews and the Arab minority, but also among the religious subgroups that make up Israeli Jewry.
