# European migrant crisis: Enlargement of the European Union: The European Union and Turkey agree on broad principles for a plan to ease the migration crisis which includes returning thousands of migrants to Turkey. For this, the EU will swiftly ease visa requirements for Turks and speed up Ankara's EU accession talks. A final agreement is to be ready for next week's two-day EU summit in Brussels, Belgium. 

The EU and Turkey agree principles of a deal on the migrant crisis that includes a radical one-in, one-out plan for Syrians fleeing the conflict.
