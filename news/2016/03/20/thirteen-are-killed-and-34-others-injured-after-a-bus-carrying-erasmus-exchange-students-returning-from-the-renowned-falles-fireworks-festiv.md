# Thirteen are killed and 34 others injured after a bus carrying Erasmus exchange students returning from the renowned Falles fireworks festival in Valencia, crashes near Freginals, Spain. The regional government of Catalonia said in a statement  that, "... according to the latest data, the ill-fated bus had students from Hungary, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Czech Republic, United Kingdom, Italy, Peru, Bulgaria, Poland, Ireland, Japan, Ukraine, Holland, Belgium, France, Palestine, Turkey, (and) Greece." 

At least one Briton is thought to have been on board a bus which crashed in Spain, killing 13 exchange students. The bus, which was carrying 57 passengers, including at least one from the UK and four from Ireland, had been travelling back from Spainâ€™s largest fireworks festival. It hit a crash barrier and was sent into oncoming traffic on a main road near Freginals, halfway between Valencia and Barcelona shortly before 6am.
