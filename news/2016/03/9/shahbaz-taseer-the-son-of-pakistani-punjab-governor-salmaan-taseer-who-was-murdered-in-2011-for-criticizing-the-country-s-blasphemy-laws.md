# Shahbaz Taseer, the son of  Pakistani Punjab governor Salmaan Taseer who was murdered in 2011 for criticizing the country's blasphemy laws, is reunited with his family  four-and-a-half years after his kidnapping. Tuesday, Shahbaz was rescued by Pakistani secret service and counter-terrorism operatives    in Kuchlak, Balochistan Province. He had been abducted in Lahore in August 2011, seven months after  his father's murder  by bodyguard Mumtaz Qadri.  Qadri was executed on  February 29, 2016. His death was claimed as the reason for the deadly Taliban suicide bombing in Shabqadar  two days ago.
