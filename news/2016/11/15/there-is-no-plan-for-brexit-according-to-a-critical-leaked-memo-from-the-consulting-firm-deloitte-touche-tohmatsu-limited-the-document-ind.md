# There is no plan for Brexit, according to a critical leaked memo from the consulting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited. The document indicates Whitehall is working on 500 Brexit-related projects. Both Deloitte and the British Government confirm the document is an internal working document from Deloitte that was compiled without government approval or assistance. 

Downing Street &quot;wholeheartedly&quot; rejects a leaked memo describing cabinet &quot;divisions&quot; over Brexit.
