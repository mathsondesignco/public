# Russia arrests Economic Development Minister Alexey Ulyukaev for allegedly seeking a bribe to approve the sale of 50 per cent of Bashneft to state-run oil producer Rosneft last month. 

Russia detained Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev on charges of taking a $2 million bribe to approve a major privatization sale, setting off shockwaves as the highest-level official to face such treatment in President Vladimir Putinâ€™s 16-year rule.
