# Contractors and suppliers for the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games claim they are owed millions in unpaid debts. 

Three months after the closing ceremonies of the 2016 Summer Olympics, vendors and fans say theyâ€™re still owed money by the local organizing committee. Some contractors and suppliers have threatened to sue over unpaid bills. Last month, 400 workers from a cleaning company brandished brooms in protest outside of the Rio 2016 headquarters.
