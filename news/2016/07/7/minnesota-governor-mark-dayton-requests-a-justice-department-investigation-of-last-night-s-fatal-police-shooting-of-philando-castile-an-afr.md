# Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton requests a Justice Department investigation of last night's fatal police shooting of Philando Castile (an African-American) during a traffic stop. Castile's girlfriend, Lavish Reynolds, streamed the incident live over Facebook. It showed Castile had been shot several times and was slumped against Reynolds; he died in Minneapolis's Hennepin County Medical Center. 

The president, reacting to a grisly video that showed Mr. Castile being shot by the police in Minnesota, asked the nation to confront racial disparities in law enforcement.
