# Shooting of Philando Castile. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton requests a Justice Department investigation of last night's fatal police shooting of Philando Castile (an African-American) during a traffic stop. Castile's girlfriend, Lavish Reynolds, streamed the incident live over Facebook. It showed Castile had been shot several times and was slumped against Reynolds; he died in Minneapolis's Hennepin County Medical Center. 

The killing of Philando Castile, 32, in suburban St. Paul, Minn., is the second police shooting of an African-American man to gain national attention this week.
