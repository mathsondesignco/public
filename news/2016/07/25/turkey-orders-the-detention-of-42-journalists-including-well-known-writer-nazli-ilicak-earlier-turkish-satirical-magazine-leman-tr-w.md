# Turkey orders the detention of 42 journalists including  well-known writer  Nazli Ilicak. Earlier, Turkish satirical magazine ''LeMan|tr'' was prevented  from publishing its post-coup edition--a cartoon on the cover showed Turkish soldiers facing off against anti-coup protesters, both pushed toward each other by giant hands. 

Turkey ordered the detention of 42 journalists on Monday, broadcaster NTV reported, under a crackdown following a failed coup that has targeted more than 60,000 people and drawn fire from the European Union.
