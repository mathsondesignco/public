# Australian federal election, 2016. Australians vote to elect a government for the next three years. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, leader of the conservative Liberal Party-led Coalition, dissolved both houses of Parliament in May in a bid for a Senate more friendly to his agenda. The final result showed the Coalition with a bare 1 seat majority in the House with 76 seats and the Australian Labor Party with 69 seats. 

For Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten, the size of the win or loss will determine whether they are secure in their positions and shape the Australian political landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.
