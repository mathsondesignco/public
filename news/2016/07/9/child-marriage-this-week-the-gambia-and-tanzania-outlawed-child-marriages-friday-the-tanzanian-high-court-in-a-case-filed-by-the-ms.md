# Child marriage. This week, the Gambia and Tanzania outlawed child marriages. Friday, the Tanzanian High Court - in a case filed by the "Msichana Initiative", a lobbying group that advocates for girls' right to education - ruled in favor of protecting girls from the harms of early marriage. And during a feast ending the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, The Gambian President Yahya Jammeh announced that child and forced marriages are banned. Jammeh called on the National Assembly to quickly take up the issue. 

The Gambia and Tanzania, both countries where more than 30% of girls are married by the age of 18, outlaw child marriage and introduce tough penalties.
