# Researchers report in the journal Nature the discovery of three potentially habitable, Earth-like exoplanets orbiting TRAPPIST-1, an ultracool dwarf star 40 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius. 

The newly discovered worlds are now the most promising targets in the search for life among the starsâ€”and the race to take a closer look at them has begun.
