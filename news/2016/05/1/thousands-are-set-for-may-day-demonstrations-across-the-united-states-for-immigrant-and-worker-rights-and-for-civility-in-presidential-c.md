# Thousands  are set for May Day demonstrations across the United States   for immigrant and worker rights, and for civility in presidential campaign rhetoric. Organizers and authorities in California are urging participants to remain calm, given the violence this week connected with Presidential campaign protests. 

May Day march organizers are asking participants to remain peaceful while police say they&#39;re ready for whatever happens following violent protests at Donald Trump&#39;s California appearances.
