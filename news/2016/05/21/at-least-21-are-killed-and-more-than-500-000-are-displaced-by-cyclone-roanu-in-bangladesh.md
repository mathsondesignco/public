#  At least 21 are killed and more than 500,000 are displaced by cyclone Roanu in Bangladesh. 

A cyclone battered coastal Bangladesh on Saturday, killing at least 21 people and injuring many more, but has now weakened into a depression that the weather office said could still bring brief periods of violent wind or rain.
