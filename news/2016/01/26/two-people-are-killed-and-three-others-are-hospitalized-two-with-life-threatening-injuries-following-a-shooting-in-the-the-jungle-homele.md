# Two people are killed and three others are hospitalized, two with life-threatening injuries, following a shooting in the "The Jungle" homeless encampment in the U.S. city of Seattle. Police are searching for two suspects. 

&quot;We don&#x27;t think they were targeted because they&#x27;re homeless. They were targeted specifically because of who they were,&quot; police chief says.
