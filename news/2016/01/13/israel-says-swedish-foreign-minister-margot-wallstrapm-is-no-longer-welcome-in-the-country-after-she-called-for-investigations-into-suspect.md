# Israel says Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom is no longer welcome in the country after she called for investigations into "suspected extrajudicial executions" of Palestinians by the Israeli army. Sweden has for many years financed NGOs such as B'Tselem and Breaking the Silence operating in Israel. 

Following an accusation by Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallström alleging that Israel carries out “extrajudicial executions” of Palestinian terrorists, her Israeli counterpart Tzipi Hotovely said that Israel is “closing its doors to official visits from Sweden.”
