# Two Australians, a doctor and his wife, have been abducted in northern Burkina Faso. The Al Qaeda-linked, Mali-based "Emirate of the Sahara" is responsible, according to SITE. 

Two Australians have been kidnapped in Burkina Faso, officials said Saturday, as a Malian Islamist group said the couple were in the hands of Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists. The Burkina government said the pair were kidnapped in Baraboule, near the west African country&#x27;s borders with Niger and Mali.
