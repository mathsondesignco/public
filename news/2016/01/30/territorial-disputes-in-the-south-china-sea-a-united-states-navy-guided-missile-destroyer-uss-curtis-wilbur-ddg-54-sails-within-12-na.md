# Territorial disputes in the South China Sea. A United States Navy guided missile destroyer, "USS Curtis Wilbur" (DDG-54), sails within 12 nautical miles of the disputed Triton Island. The Pentagon said that the mission aimed at countering the "excessive maritime claims of parties that claim the Paracel Islands", while China's Ministry of Defense said the U.S. action -severely violated the law." 

The US sails a warship close to a disputed island in the South China Sea, in what China calls a violation of its laws.
