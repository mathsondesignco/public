# French police shoot dead a knife-wielding man, who was shouting "Allahu Akbar", outside a police station in Goutte d'Or, located in the 18th arrondissement of Paris. A piece of paper with an Islamic State flag and claim for the attack written in Arabic was found on his body. The incident is noted for taking place on the anniversary of last year's ''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting. 

Paris police shoot dead a man carrying a meat cleaver exactly a year after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, as President Hollande promises to boost security.

The commander's partner, a female administrative police official, is found dead inside the home, while a young boy is rescued physically unharmed.
