# The FBI, in armored vehicles, closes to within 50 yards (40 meters) of the last four anti-government militants occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Negotiations to end the standoff without violence continue. 

The four holdouts in the armed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon surrendered on Thursday, with the last protester repeatedly threatening suicide in a dramatic final phone call with mediators before he gave up, ending the 41-day standoff.
