# Swiss citizens vote on four referenda, including one,  proposed by the right-wing Swiss People's Party,  that would automatically expel foreigners who commit two minor crimes. Current law  calls for deportation of non-citizens convicted of murder or sexual violence. 

People in Switzerland reject a plan to automatically expel foreigners who commit minor crimes.
