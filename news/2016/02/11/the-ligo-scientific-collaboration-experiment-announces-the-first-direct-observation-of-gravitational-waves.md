1. [Gravitational-wave astronomy. Scientists announce that the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) has made a third detection of gravitational waves, named GW170104. The signal beam, detected on 4 January 2017, apparently results from a merger of two black holes of 19 and 31 solar masses. Such detections are said to be progressively moving this emerging field in astronomy "from novelty to new observational science". ](/news/2017/06/1/gravitational-wave-astronomy-scientists-announce-that-the-advanced-laser-interferometer-gravitational-wave-observatory-ligo-has-made-a-th.md) _Context: gravitational waves_
