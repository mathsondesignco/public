# A new study by scientists from 14 research institutions, that is published in the March 2016 Global Change Biology Journal, finds all U.S. forests are threatened by drought and climate change. 

Forests nationwide are feeling the heat from increasing drought and climate change, according to a study by scientists from 14 research institutions.
