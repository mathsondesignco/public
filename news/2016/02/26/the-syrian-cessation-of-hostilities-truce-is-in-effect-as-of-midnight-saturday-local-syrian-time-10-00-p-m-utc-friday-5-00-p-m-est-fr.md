# The Syrian cessation of hostilities truce is in effect, as of midnight, Saturday,  local Syrian time (10:00 p.m. UTC Friday/5:00 p.m. EST Friday). 

Guns mostly fell silent in Syria and Russian air raids stopped on Saturday, the first day of a cessation of hostilities that the United Nations has described as the best hope for peace in five years of civil war.
