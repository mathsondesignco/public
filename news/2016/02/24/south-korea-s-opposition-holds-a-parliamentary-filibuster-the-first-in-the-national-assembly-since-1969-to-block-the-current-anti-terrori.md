# South Korea's opposition holds a parliamentary filibuster, the first in the National Assembly  since 1969, to block the current anti-terrorism bill that would expand National Intelligence Service powers. The opposition plans to continue until March 11, when the session is scheduled to end. 

Wearing a white sweater and a blue blazer, her eyes framed by round spectacles, Eun Soo-mi looked more like a librarian than a political saboteur as she approached the podium in South Koreaâ€™s parliament at 2:30 a.m. on Wednesday.
