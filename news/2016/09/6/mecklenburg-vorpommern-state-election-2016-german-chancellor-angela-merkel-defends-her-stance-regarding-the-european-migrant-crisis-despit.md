# Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election, 2016: German Chancellor Angela Merkel defends her stance regarding the European migrant crisis despite her party losing in the key election. 

Angela Merkel has vowed to &quot;win back trust&quot; after her party suffered a humiliating defeat against the anti-migrant AfD in state elections. The result has been blamed on voter disenchantment with her refugee policy.
