# Presidency of A former militiaman claims while testifying at a hearing by the Philippine Senate that President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte ordered the deaths of criminals and political opponents, allegedly Leila de Lima, critic and journalist Juan Pala, and unidentified Filipino Muslims in 1993, while he was mayor of Davao City. The witness also revealed that Duterte's son Paolo may also have been involved in the murders as an accomplice to his father. 

(UPDATE 4 - 12:28 p.m.) A self-confessed member of the so-called &#039;Davao Death Squad&#039; recited Thursday a litany of more than a thousand murders over than three decades he claimed were carried out on orders of then Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and his son Paolo, the incumbent vice mayor.
