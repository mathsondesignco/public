# Budi Waseso, head of Indonesia's National Narcotics Agency (BNN, {{Interlanguage link multi|Badan Narkotika Nasional|id}}), says he plans on copying Rodrigo Duterte's hardline tactics against drug traffickers, which have killed almost 3,000 people in the Philippines. 

Indonesia&#039;s anti-drugs chief says he supports implementing a bloody crackdown on traffickers like the war on crime in the Philippines.
