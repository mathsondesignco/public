# Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union. The European Union's 28 member states formally accept Bosnia and Herzegovina's membership application. The European Commission (EC) will now determine whether Bosnia meets the criteria to join the union, a process that is expected to take a year. 

EU members states have accepted Bosnia&#39;s membership application, starting a long process to decide on its candidacy. Bosnia&#39;s membership process is particularly complicated given the country&#39;s governance structure.
