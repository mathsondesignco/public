# The European Union's 28 member states formally accept Bosnia and Herzegovina's membership application. The European Commission (EC) will now determine whether Bosnia meets the criteria to join the union, a process that is expected to take a year. 

EU members states have accepted Bosnia&#39;s membership application, starting a long process to decide on its candidacy. Bosnia&#39;s membership process is particularly complicated given the country&#39;s governance structure.
