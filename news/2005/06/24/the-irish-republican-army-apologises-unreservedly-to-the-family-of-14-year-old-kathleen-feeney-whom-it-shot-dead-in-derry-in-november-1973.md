#  The Irish Republican Army apologises unreservedly to the family of 14-year-old Kathleen Feeney, whom it shot dead in Derry in November 1973. The IRA had previously blamed the British Army for the killing. 

The Sinn FÃ©in President, Gerry Adams, has said that he is fairly certain that the bodies of the so-called disappeared will be re-united with their families.
