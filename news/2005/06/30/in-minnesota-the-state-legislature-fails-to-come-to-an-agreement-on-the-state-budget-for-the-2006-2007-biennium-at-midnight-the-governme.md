#  In Minnesota, the state legislature fails to come to an agreement on the state budget for the 2006-2007 biennium. At midnight, the government shuts down, leading to cries of derision from state residents and both of the state's largest newspapers, the liberal-leaning ''Star Tribune'' and the conservative-leaning ''St. Paul Pioneer Press''.
