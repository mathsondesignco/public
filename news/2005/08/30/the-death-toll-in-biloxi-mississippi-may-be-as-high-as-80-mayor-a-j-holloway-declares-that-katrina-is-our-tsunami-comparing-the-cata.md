#  The death toll in Biloxi, Mississippi, may be as high as 80. Mayor A.J. Holloway declares that Katrina "is our tsunami", comparing the catastrophe to the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami. 

Miss. governor estimates 80 could be dead in one county alone; two levees break in New Orleans, flooding the city.
