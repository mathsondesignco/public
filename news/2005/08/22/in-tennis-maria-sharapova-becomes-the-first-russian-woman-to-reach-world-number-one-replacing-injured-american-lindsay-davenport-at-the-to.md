Meldonium became a banned substance on January 1, 2016. A large number of athletes, including grand-slam tennis champion Maria Sharapova, had taken the medication in the past, and  have tested positive this year. The new data will address how long meldonium stays in the body and determine if athletes were provided a reasonable amount of time to adhere to the new restrictions prior to testing. The drug was used by many Soviet-bloc athletes since the 80s. ](/news/2016/04/13/the-world-anti-doping-agency-advises-that-wada-accredited-laboratories-are-currently-conducting-studies-on-meldonium-excretion-rates-since-e.md) _Context: Maria Sharapova_
