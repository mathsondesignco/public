#  Australian State and Territory leaders agree to implement the Commonwealth Government's tough new anti-terrorism laws with a sunset clause. The new laws allow police to detain terrorism "suspects" without charge for up to two weeks, and electronically tag them for up to a year. The measures have been attacked by civil libertarians and Muslim groups.
