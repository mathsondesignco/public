Angela Merkel (CDU) and Franz Mntefering (SPD) were elected chairpersons of their respective Parliamentary parties. German green politician Joschka Fischer announced his retirement from leading the Green party in the newly elected Parliament, retiring to become an "elder statesman" in the back benches.
