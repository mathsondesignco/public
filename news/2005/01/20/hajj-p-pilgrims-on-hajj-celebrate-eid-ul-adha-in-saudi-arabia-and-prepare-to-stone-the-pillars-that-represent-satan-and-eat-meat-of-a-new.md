#  Hajj: Pilgrims on Hajj celebrate Eid ul-Adha in Saudi Arabia, and prepare to stone the pillars that represent satan, and eat meat of a newly killed animal, while giving meat to those less fortunate as ''qurbani''. Hajj Celebrations will also be held around the world, but some will wait until Friday.
