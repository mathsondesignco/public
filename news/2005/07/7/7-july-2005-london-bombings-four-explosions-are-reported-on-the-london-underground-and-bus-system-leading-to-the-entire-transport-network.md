#  7 July 2005 London bombings: Four explosions are reported on the London Underground and bus system, leading to the entire transport network being shut down. A previously unheard-of splinter group of al-Qaeda has claimed responsibility, though their involvement has not yet been verified.  The attacks have left at least 50 people dead and roughly 700 others injured.
