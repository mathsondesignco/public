The nearby office of Arab satellite channel Abu Dhabi is also hit by air strikes. Al Jazeera accuses the U.S. of attacking Arab media to hide facts. On the same day a U.S. tank fires into the 15th floor of the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad, where almost all remaining foreign journalists are based, and kills two cameramen and wounds three. In the Abu Dhabi case the station airs the picture of Iraqi fire from beneath of the camera. In the hotel case, however, other journalists on the scene deny any fire from or around the hotel.,](/news/2003/04/8/deaths-of-three-journalists-in-baghdad-two-american-air-to-surface-missiles-hit-the-qatar-satellite-station-al-jazeera-s-office-in-baghdad.md) _Context: Al Jazeera, Arab_
