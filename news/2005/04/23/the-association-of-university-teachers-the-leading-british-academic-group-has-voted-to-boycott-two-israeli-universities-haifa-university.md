#  The Association of University Teachers, the leading British academic group, has voted to boycott two Israeli universities, Haifa University and Bar-Ilan University, over their alleged involvement in "illegal activity" in the occupied territories. The AUT said it voted for the boycott in response to a plea for action by a group of Palestinian academics. It was condemned by the Israeli Embassy, the British Ambassador in Israel, by Jewish Human Rights groups and by Universities UK. 

Palestinians suspected of attempting to carry out terror attack apparently illegal workers; roadblocks set up due to terror alert cause major traffic jams throughout central Israel, thousands returning from seder stuck in cars for hours
