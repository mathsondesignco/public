#  Syria and Iraq recall their ambassadors over a dispute following the recent bombings in Baghdad last week. 

&lt;div>Iraq and Syria recalled their envoys Tuesday, deepening a diplomatic crisis sparked by Iraqi accusations that Damascus is sheltering insurgents who orchestrated massive truck bombings in Baghdad.&nbsp;The flare-up threw into disarray extensive efforts made in the past year to boost ties between the countries, which had been weak under former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein but had recently been improving.&lt;/div>
