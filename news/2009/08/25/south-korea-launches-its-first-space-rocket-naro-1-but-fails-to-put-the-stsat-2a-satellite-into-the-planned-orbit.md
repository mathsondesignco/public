#  South Korea launches its first space rocket, ''Naro-1'', but fails to put the STSAT-2A satellite into the planned orbit. 

GOHEUNG, South Jeolla Province _ South Korea bumbled its way into the Asian space race Tuesday, with the Naro Space Center witnessing the liftoff of the countryâ€™s first space rocket, Korea Space Launch Vehicle 1 (KSLV-1). However, the satellite that the launcher was delivering may just be lost in space or dumped at sea.
