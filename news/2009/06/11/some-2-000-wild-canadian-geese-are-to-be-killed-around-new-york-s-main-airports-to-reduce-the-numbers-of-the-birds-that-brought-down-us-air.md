#  Some 2,000 wild Canadian geese are to be killed around New York's main airports to reduce the numbers of the birds that brought down US Airways Flight 1549 in January. 

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the Hudson River landing of US Airways Flight 1549 &#8220;served as a catalyst to strengthen our efforts in removing geese from, and discouraging them from nesting on, city property near our runways.&#8221;.
