#  An 8.3 magnitude earthquake strikes the Samoa Islands, triggering a tsunami that kills at least 20 in the nation of Samoa and another 14 in American Samoa. 

Authorities canceled a Pacific tsunami warning on Wednesday after a huge sub-sea quake sent waves over the Samoa islands, reportedly killing about 14 people but falling short of a regional disaster.
