#  Serbians, Macedonians, and Montenegrins are able to travel to continental Europe without a visa from this day on. 

Today, for the first time in nearly two decades, millions of Serbs and other former Yugoslavs will be entitled to leave their countries and go almost anywhere in Europe without a visa. The end of the visa barrier, which falls on the festival of St Nicholas, comes 18 years after Slobodan Milosevic led Yugoslavia into the cold â€“ and marks a new welcome for a nation that has long been shunned by the rest of Europe.
