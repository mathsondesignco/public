#  Australia's Transport Safety Bureau finds that the autopilot of Qantas Flight 72, which made an emergency landing at Learmonth Airport in October 2008, received inaccurate information, causing a rapid change in altitude. 

Safety investigator&#039;s report finds electronic error led to dangerous plunge mid-flight over WA last year.
