#  California's State Legislature approves a US$143-billion budget and fills a $41-billion deficit with a combination of loans, spending and service reductions, and tax increases. 

Economists say that Californiaâ€™s budget foreshadows the difficult choices other state legislatures will soon face as the economy worsens.
