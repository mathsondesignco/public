#  Russia, Iran and Turkey reach an agreement, effective this midnight, to establish four "safe zones" in Syria over which all military aircraft, including Turkish, Russian, and American aircraft, will be barred from flying. 

U.S. and coalition military planes will not be allowed to fly over designated safe zones in Syria under a Russian proposal that has the backing of Iran and Turkey, reports said Friday.
