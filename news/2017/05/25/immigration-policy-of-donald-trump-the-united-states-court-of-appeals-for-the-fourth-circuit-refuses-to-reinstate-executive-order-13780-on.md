# Immigration policy of Donald Trump. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit refuses to reinstate Executive Order 13780 on the basis of religious discrimination, upholding the District Court for Maryland's March 7 ruling. 

In a stinging rebuke to President Donald Trump, a U.S. appeals court refused on Thursday to reinstate his temporary travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority nations, setting the stage for a possible legal showdown in the Supreme Court.
