# The Office for National Statistics in Great Britain says that consumer prices in Britain rose by an annualized 2.7% in April, the highest level of inflation in almost four years. 

British inflation hit its highest level since September 2013 last month, extending its sharp rise since the vote to leave the European Union and tightening the squeeze on living costs as a national election approaches.
