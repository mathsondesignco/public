### [2017-03-18](/news/2017/03/18/index.md)

# Around 1,500-2,000 people leave al-Waer district of Homs today for their preferred destination of either Northern Homs Governorate, Idlib Governorate or Turkish Army positions in Northern Aleppo Governorate. Up to 15,000 to 20,000 people including armed militants, their families and supporters will leave the besieged district in the coming weeks with the rest of the population reconciling and receiving aid. 

Homs was once dubbed the &quot;capital of the revolution&quot; and al-Wair is the last rebel-held district.
