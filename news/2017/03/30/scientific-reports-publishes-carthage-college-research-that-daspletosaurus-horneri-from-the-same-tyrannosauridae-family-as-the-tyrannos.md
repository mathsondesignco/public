# "Scientific Reports" publishes Carthage College research that "Daspletosaurus horneri", from the same Tyrannosauridae family as the Tyrannosaurus rex, had a sensitive nose. The research describes that foramina sprouted from the trigeminal nerve at the snout and jaws possibly enabling the behavioral functions of exploration, courtship, nesting, foreplay, and parental investment. 

Tyrannosaurs had sensitive snouts that they may have enjoyed rubbing together while mating, scientists say
