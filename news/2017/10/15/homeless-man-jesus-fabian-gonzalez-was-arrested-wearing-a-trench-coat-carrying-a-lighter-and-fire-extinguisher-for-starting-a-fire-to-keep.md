#  Homeless man Jesus Fabian Gonzalez was arrested wearing a trench coat carrying a lighter and fire extinguisher for starting a fire "to keep warm" in Sonoma County, California. He is being held in jail on an arson and unrelated drug charge. When ICE asked to detain him for deportation Sheriff Rob Giordano refused as administrative detainers are unconstitutional. ICE stated it was "troubling in light of the massive wildfires...criminals who would otherwise be deported will be released". Right-wing websites including Breitbart and InfoWars were debunked after linking the arrest to deadly October 2017 Northern California wildfires but Sheriff Rob Giordano said that "There's no indication he's related to these fires at all" and accused ICE of attacking "the sheriff's office in the midst of the largest natural disaster this county has ever experienced" 

Right-wing media sites Breitbart and InfoWars – without evidence – link the arrest of a 29-year-old Latino man Sunday October 15, 2017 to the catastrophic wine country fires that have killed at least 28 people in the area.
