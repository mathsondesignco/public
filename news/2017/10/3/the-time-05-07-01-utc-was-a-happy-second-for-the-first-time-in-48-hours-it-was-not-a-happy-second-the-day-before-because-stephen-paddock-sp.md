# The time 05:07:01 UTC was a happy second for the first time in 48 hours. It was not a happy second the day before because Stephen Paddock spent 05:05-05:15, which includes 05:07:01, in a successful attempt to break the mass shooting record. It was also the first happy "05:07:01" in the last quarter of the year.
