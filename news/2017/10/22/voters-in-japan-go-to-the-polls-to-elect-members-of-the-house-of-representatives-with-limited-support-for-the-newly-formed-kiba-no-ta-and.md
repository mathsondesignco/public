# Voters in Japan go to the polls to elect members of the House of Representatives. With limited support for the newly formed Kibo no To and Constitutional Democratic parties, opinion polls predict that the right-wing Liberal Democratic Party's Shinzo Abe, who called the snap election, will remain Prime Minister. 

Millions are voting in the election, which was called by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last month.
