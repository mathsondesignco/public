# The LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave observatories detect for the first time gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars. The event GW170817, coinciding with a short gamma ray burst detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, lead to immediate follow-up observations by the Hubble space telescope and numerous ground-based telescopes. This confirms the theory according to which neutron star mergers are a cause of short gamma-ray bursts.

The signal beam, detected on 4 January 2017, apparently results from a merger of two black holes of 19 and 31 solar masses. Such detections are said to be progressively moving this emerging field in astronomy "from novelty to new observational science". ](/news/2017/06/1/scientists-announce-that-the-advanced-laser-interferometer-gravitational-wave-observatory-ligo-has-made-a-third-detection-of-gravitational.md) _Context: Gravitational-wave astronomy, LIGO_
