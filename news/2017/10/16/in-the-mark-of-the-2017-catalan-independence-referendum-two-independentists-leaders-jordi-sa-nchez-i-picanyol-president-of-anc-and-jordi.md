# In the mark of the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, two independentists leaders, Jordi Sanchez i Picanyol (President of ANC) and Jordi Cuixart i Navarro (President of Omnium Cultural) are in pre-trial detention during the sedition trial. These events outraged the population of the State and the Government of Catalonia, causing a new escalation of tension between both governments. 

A Spanish judge has ruled that the leaders of the two biggest grassroots pro-independence associations in Catalonia should remain in prison without bail on possible charges of sedition - for which, if convicted, they could face prison sentences of up to 10 years.
