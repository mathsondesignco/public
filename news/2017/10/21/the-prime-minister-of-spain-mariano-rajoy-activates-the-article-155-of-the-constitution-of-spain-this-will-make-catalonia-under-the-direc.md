# The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, activates the article 155 of the Constitution of Spain. This will make Catalonia under the direct control of the State, removing the regional Government and completely limit the power of the Parliament of Catalonia. The regional police and media will also be under its control. 

Mariano Rajoy, in an unexpectedly forceful move, said Madrid would take control of the independence-minded region, pushing out its separatist administration.
