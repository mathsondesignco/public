# Unnamed White House officials believe White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly's personal cellphone was hacked, possibly since December 2016. Kelly was Secretary of Homeland Security from January 20 to July 31, 2017, when he moved to his current position. 

White House tech support discovered the suspected breach after Kelly turned his phone in to tech support staff this summer.
