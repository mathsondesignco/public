# The Ministry of Justice of Peru appoints a new head on the Direction of Presidentials Graces. This is understood as a more step of the Pedro Pablo Kuczynski Administration, although he has denied it, towards to granting of the pardon of the former president Alberto Fujimori, sentenced for acts of corruption and Human Rights violations. Fujimori, who is in jail since 2007 and whose health has deteriorated with the passage of the years, especially for a alleged tongue cancer, has applied for pardon unsuccessfully on two occasions. He ruled Peru from 1990 to 2000 and is currently 79 years old.
