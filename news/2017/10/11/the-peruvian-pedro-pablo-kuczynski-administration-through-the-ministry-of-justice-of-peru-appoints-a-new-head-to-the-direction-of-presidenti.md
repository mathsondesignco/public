# The Peruvian Pedro Pablo Kuczynski Administration through the Ministry of Justice of Peru appoints a new head to the Direction of Presidentials Graces in order to grant a pardon to 79-year-old former president Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000). In April 2009, a three-judge panel had sentenced Fujimori for acts of corruption and Human Rights violations. Fujimori, who has been in jail since 2007 and whose health has deteriorated, including alleged tongue cancer, has applied for a pardon unsuccessfully on two occasions.
