# A panel of external experts to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration unanimously vote that the benefits of the gene replacement treatment made by Spark Therapeutics of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, called voretigene neparvovec (trade name, Luxturna), which treats a form of hereditary blindness, Leber's congenital amaurosis, outweigh its risks. 

Therapy that targets disease-causing mutations could become the first of its kind approved for use in the United States.
