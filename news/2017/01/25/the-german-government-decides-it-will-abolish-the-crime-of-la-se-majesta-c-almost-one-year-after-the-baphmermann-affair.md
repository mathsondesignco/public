# The German government decides it will abolish the crime of lese-majeste, almost one year after the Bohmermann affair. 

The German government voted Wednesday to scrap a &quot;lese majeste&quot; law that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had sought to employ against a popular German television satirist.
