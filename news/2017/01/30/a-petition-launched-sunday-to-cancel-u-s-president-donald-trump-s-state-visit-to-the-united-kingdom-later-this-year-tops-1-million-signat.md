# A petition, launched Sunday to cancel U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom later this year, tops 1 million signatures, passing the threshold for British Parliament debate. A British government spokesman says the state visit is going ahead as planned. 

The petition suggested it should be canceled &quot;because it would cause embarrassment&quot; to Queen Elizabeth II.
