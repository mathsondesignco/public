# Austria agrees to ban the full-face veil (burqa and niqab) in public spaces,  part of a larger deal struck by the center-left Social Democratic Party  and the center-right Austrian People's Party to avoid the collapse of the ruling coalition government.  

The governing coalition may also prevent civil servants from wearing religious symbols.
