# For the second consecutive day, hundreds of thousands of Togolese protest against President Faure Gnassingbe's 50-year family dynasty. Parliament is set to consider presidential term limits when it reconvenes in October. 

Togo security forces fired tear gas at hundreds of anti-government protesters carrying out a late night sit-in at an intersection in central Lome as part of a bid to end the 50-year-old Gnassingbe family dynasty, witnesses said on Thursday.
