# The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant releases footage which apparently show its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi urging his followers to expand their attacks against "crusaders and apostates". 

The extremist group released what it said was a new recording of its leader, Abu Bakr Baghdadi, a move apparently intended to counter rumors of his death and rally followers after battlefield losses.
