#  MIT physics professor Daniel Rothman's mathematical formula, published in the peer-review journal "Science Advances", predicts a sixth mass extinction will likely occur by the year 2100 if the recent rise in carbon dioxide emissions continues and a critical amount of carbon (310 gigatons) is added to the oceans. 

In the past 540 million years, the Earth has endured five mass extinction events, each involving processes that upended the normal cycling of carbon through the atmosphere and oceans. These globally fatal perturbations in carbon each unfolded over thousands to millions of years, and are coincident with the widespread extermination of marine species around the world.
