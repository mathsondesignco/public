# Tens of thousands of protesters march through Dublin to demand Ireland to change its abortion laws, and anti-abortion activists stage counter-demonstrations. A pro-choice rally is held outside the Irish embassy in London. 

It is the first demonstration since PM Varadkar said he would hold a referendum on the issue.
