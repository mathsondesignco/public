# The Trump Administration announces it is ending the DACA program that has protected from deportation those who illegally entered the U.S. before their 16th birthday and before June 2007. Congress is called upon to pass legislation to correct the situation. The so-called Dreamers have been living in the country under "lawful status." The Department of Homeland Security says it will no longer accept new applications but those enrolled in DACA will be able to continue working until their permits expire. 

The Obama-era program will expire in six months, the administration said on Tuesday. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals granted legal protections to roughly 800,000 people.
