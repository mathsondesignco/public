# The Trump Administration announces that, during the next six months, it will be ending the DACA program that has halted the deportation of about 800,000 people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Congress is called upon to pass legislation to correct the situation. 

As early as March, officials said, some of the roughly 800,000 beneficiaries of the program could become eligible for deportation.
