# North Korea has claimed to have developed a hydrogen bomb that can be fitted on a ballistic missile. It later claimed that the seismic tremor was caused by the bomb test. 

North Koreaâ€™s state news agency offered no evidence for the claim, other than a photo of what it said was a hydrogen bomb ready to be loaded onto an ICBM.
