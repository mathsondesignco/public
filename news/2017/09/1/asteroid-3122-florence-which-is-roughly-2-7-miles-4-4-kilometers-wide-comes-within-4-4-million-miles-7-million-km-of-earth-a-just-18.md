# Asteroid 3122 Florence, which is roughly 2.7-miles (4.4 kilometers) wide, comes within 4.4 million miles (7 million km) of Earth -- just 18 times the distance from our planet to the moon. 

A mountain-size space rock cruised past Earth this morning (Sept. 1) in a record-breaking encounter that has long had scientists drooling.
