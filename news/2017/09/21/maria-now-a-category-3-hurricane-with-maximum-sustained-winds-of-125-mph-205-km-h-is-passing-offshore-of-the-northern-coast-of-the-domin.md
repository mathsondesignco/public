# Maria, now a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km-h), is passing offshore of the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, expected to impact the Turks and Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas later tonight and Friday. 

Puerto Ricans are facing the crushing devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria â€” splintered homes, uprooted trees and floodwaters coursing through streets.
