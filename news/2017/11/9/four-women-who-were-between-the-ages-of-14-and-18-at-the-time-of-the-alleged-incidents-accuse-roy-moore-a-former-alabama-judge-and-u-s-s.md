# Four women (who were between the ages of 14 and 18 at the time of the alleged incidents) accuse Roy Moore, a former Alabama judge and U.S. Senate candidate, of sexual misconduct. The allegations state that, during a period from the 1970s and early 1980s, Moore - who was in his 30s at the time - had or attempted to engage in inappropriate sexual contact with each of the three accusers, who say he did not force them into a relationship or having non-consensual sexual contact. Some Republican politicians distance themselves from Moore, who has vehemently denied the allegations, accusing it of being a plot by "The Washington Post" (which published the story) and the Democratic Party to derail his special election campaign against Democrat Doug Jones. 

GOP senators call on Moore to drop out of race as aides say report that he had inappropriate sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32 is ‘fake news’
