# Refuse Fascism holds protests against U.S. President Donald Trump in several major cities, including New York City, Chicago, and San Francisco. 

Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of downtown Los Angeles on Saturday to rail against the Trump administration and its policies, but the march was nothing like the huge demonstrations held across the country after last yearâ€™s presidential election. The group Refuse Fascism called for protests against Trump in several major cities on Saturday, including New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
