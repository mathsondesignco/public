# The United States will end the so-called temporary protected status program (TPS) for more than 300,000 refugees from several countries: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Many of the refugees have already left for Canada, where it is easier to get asylum. 

The Department of Homeland Security is expected to make an announcement next Monday to decide the fate of Hondurans, Salvadorans, Nicaraguans and Haitians whose TPS status is set to expire in early January.
