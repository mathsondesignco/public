# The United States will end the temporary protected status program (TPS) for more than 300,000 refugees from El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Many of the refugees have already left for Canada, where it is easier to get asylum. 

The Department of Homeland Security is expected to make an announcement next Monday to decide the fate of Hondurans, Salvadorans, Nicaraguans and Haitians whose TPS status is set to expire in early January.
