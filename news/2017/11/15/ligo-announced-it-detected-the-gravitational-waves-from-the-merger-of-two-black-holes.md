1. [Scientists announce that the LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave observatories detected for the first time gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars. The event coincided with a short gamma ray burst GRB 170817A detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, leading to SSS17a, the immediate follow-up observations by the Hubble space telescope and numerous ground-based telescopes. This confirms the theory according to which neutron star mergers are the cause of at least some short gamma-ray bursts. ](/news/2017/10/16/scientists-announce-that-the-ligo-and-virgo-gravitational-wave-observatories-detected-for-the-first-time-gravitational-waves-from-the-merger.md) _Context: LIGO_

The signal beam, detected on 4 January 2017, apparently results from a merger of two black holes of 19 and 31 solar masses. Such detections are said to be progressively moving this emerging field in astronomy "from novelty to new observational science". ](/news/2017/06/1/scientists-announce-that-the-advanced-laser-interferometer-gravitational-wave-observatory-ligo-has-made-a-third-detection-of-gravitational.md) _Context: LIGO_
