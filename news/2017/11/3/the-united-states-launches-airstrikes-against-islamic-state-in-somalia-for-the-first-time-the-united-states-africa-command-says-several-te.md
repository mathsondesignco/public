# The United States launches airstrikes against Islamic State in Somalia for the first time. The United States Africa Command says "several terrorists" were killed in the strikes, which took place in coordination with Somalia's government. 

The US military for the first time has conducted two air strikes against Isis group fighters in Somalia. A US official said the strikes were carried out in northeastern Somalia, with the first around midnight local time and the second later in the morning. The official was not authorised to discuss the mission publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity. Isis-linked fighters are a growing presence in the Horn of Africa nation long threatened by the al-Qaeda-linked extremist group al-Shabaab.
