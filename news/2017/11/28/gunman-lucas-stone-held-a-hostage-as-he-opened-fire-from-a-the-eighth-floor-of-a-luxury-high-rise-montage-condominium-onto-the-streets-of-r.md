#  Gunman Lucas Stone held a hostage as he opened fire from a the eighth floor of a luxury high-rise Montage condominium onto the streets of Reno. Stone was killed in an officer-involved shooting after a SWAT team entered his barricaded condo. [http:--www.latimes.com-nation-nationnow-la-na-reno-shooting-20171128-story.html ("LA Times")] Investigators suggest the attack was not planned and as he did not hit or appear to be aiming at anyone on the street, the gunman may have been hallucinating. [http:--www.foxnews.com-us-2017-11-30-police-identify-reno-high-rise-gunman-killed-by-swat-team.html ("Fox News")][http:--www.mercurynews.com-2017-11-30-police-identify-reno-high-rise-gunman-killed-by-swat-team- ("Mercury News")] No terrorist or other motive was established in the incident which raised fears of another massacre like the 2017 Las Vegas shooting two months previous.
