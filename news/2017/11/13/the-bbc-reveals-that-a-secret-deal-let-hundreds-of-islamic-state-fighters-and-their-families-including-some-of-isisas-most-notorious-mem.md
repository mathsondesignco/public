# The BBC reveals that a secret deal let hundreds of Islamic State fighters and their families, including some of ISIS's "most notorious members," escape from Raqqa in a convoy that was between 6 to 7 km long. The United States government confirms that the deal with ISIS was made and that the evacuations took place.

The BBC has uncovered details of a secret deal that let hundreds of IS fighters â€“ including foreign militants - and their families escape from Raqqa in Syria. In exchange for freeing hostages, a convoy which stretched for miles, was able to leave the city freely - under the gaze of the US and UK-led coalition and Kurdish forces who control the city.
