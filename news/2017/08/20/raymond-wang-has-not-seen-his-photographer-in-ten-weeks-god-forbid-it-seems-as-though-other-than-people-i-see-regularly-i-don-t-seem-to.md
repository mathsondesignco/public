# Raymond Wang has not seen his photographer in ten weeks. God forbid, it seems as though, other than people I see regularly, I don't seem to see ANYONE any more these days. She last came to my house on Sunday, June 11, 2017, at 10:15 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4), and stayed for three hours, and so far, that is still her most recent visit. I do still see EK Lung, my English Language Arts tutor, but I see him twice a week anyways. Given the hundreds of people I have known through the years other than family and scheduled, YOU WOULD THINK THAT SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, SOME TIME, WOULD SEE ME SOONER OR LATER.
