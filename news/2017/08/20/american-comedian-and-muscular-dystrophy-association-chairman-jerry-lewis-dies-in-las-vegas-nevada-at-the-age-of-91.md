# American comedian and Muscular Dystrophy Association chairman Jerry Lewis dies in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the age of 91. 

Once Hollywood&#x27;s most bankable star, Lewis fronted more than 50 movies, from the light Martin-and-Lewis fare of &quot;Artists and Models&quot; to Martin Scorsese&#x27;s darkly funny &quot;The King of Comedy.&quot;
