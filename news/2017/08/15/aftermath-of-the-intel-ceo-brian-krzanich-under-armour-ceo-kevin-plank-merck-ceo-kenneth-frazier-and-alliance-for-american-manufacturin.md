#  Aftermath of the Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, and  Alliance for American Manufacturing president Scott Paul resign from President Trump's American Manufacturing Council due to their disagreements with Trump's August 12 speech denouncing the incidents at the rally, for which Trump was criticized for not specifically referencing the violent clashes caused by and the views of white supremacists in the initial statement. 

President Trump, on a day he faced a rebuke from Walmart’s C.E.O. and another departure from his manufacturing council, said the executives were “embarrassed” for making products overseas.
