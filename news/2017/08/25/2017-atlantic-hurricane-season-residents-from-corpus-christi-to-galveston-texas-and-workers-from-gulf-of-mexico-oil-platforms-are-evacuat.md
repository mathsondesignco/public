# 2017 Atlantic hurricane season: Residents from Corpus Christi to Galveston, Texas, and workers from Gulf of Mexico oil platforms are evacuating in anticipation of Hurricane Harvey's landfall, perhaps by late Friday, as a Category 3 storm, the strongest hurricane to hit mainland United States since 2005. The National Hurricane Center predicts Harvey will linger over Texas for days, dumping 15-25 inches (38-64 centimeters), and as much 35 inches (89 cm) of rain on some parts of the state. 

Hurricane Harvey intensified early on Friday, spinning into potentially the biggest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in more than a decade, with life-threatening floods expected along the Gulf Coast.
