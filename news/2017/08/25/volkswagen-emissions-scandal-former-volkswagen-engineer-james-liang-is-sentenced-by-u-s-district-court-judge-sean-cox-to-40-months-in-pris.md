# Volkswagen emissions scandal: Former Volkswagen engineer James Liang is sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Sean Cox to 40 months in prison and a $200,000 fine for his role in the decade-long scheme to cheat on federal emissions tests for diesel-powered cars sold in the United States. He is the first company employee sent to prison in the scandal. 

A federal judge sentenced a key player in a decade-long scheme to evade federal emissions rules. The term was stiffer than prosecutors recommended.
