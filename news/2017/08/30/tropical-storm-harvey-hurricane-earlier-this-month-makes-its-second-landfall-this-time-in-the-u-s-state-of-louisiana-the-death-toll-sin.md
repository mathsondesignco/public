# Tropical storm Harvey (hurricane earlier this month) makes its second landfall, this time in the U.S. state of Louisiana. The death toll since last Friday is now 38, according to local officials in Texas. Moving northeast, Harvey is expected to gradually weaken to a tropical depression by tonight. 

The death toll from Harvey was rising and officials said their rescue effort was nowhere near done.
