# Five transgender United States military personnel sue President Donald Trump and top Pentagon officials over the President's policy change announced late last month banning transgender people from serving in the military. The suit asks the court to prevent the ban from going into effect. 

The lawsuit was filed by two rights groups, but others say they are holding off until the Trump administration takes steps toward implementing the ban.
