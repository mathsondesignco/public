Six French soldiers have been injured after a car slammed into them before speeding off in a suspected terror attack in Paris. The BMW was parked in an alley before it accelerated into the soldiers as they left their barracks to go on patrol, Patrick Balkany, the mayor of Levallois-Perret, said. &quot;The vehicle did not stop. It hurtled at them... it accelerated rapidly,&quot; he told broadcaster BFM TV.
