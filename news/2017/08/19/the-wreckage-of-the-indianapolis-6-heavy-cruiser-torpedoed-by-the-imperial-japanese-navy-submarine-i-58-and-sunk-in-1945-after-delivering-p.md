# The wreckage of the Indianapolis 6 heavy cruiser, torpedoed by the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine I-58 and sunk in 1945 after delivering parts for the Little Boy atomic weapon, is discovered on the floor of the North Pacific Ocean. Only 317 of the U.S. Sailors-Marines who survived the sinking were finally rescued after 4-5 days in shark-infested waters.
