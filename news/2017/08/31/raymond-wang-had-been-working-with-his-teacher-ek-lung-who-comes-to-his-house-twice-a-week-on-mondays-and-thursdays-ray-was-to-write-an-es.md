# Raymond Wang had been working with his teacher EK Lung, who comes to his house twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays. Ray was to write an essay on Google Docs about his laptop, and at 10:15 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (September 1, 2017, 02:15 UTC), teacher Lung asked him to restart his laptop and track how long it took for the laptop to reboot. At 10:19:28, Lung went out of his way to comment on the slowness of the computer, so 10:19:28 p.m. was NOT a happy second that night. That second was pink blood.
