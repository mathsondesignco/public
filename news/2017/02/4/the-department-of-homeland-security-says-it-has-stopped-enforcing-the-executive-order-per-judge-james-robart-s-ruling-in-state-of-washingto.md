# The Department of Homeland Security says it has stopped enforcing the executive order per Judge James Robart's ruling in "State of Washington v. Trump". The State Department activates visas that had been previously suspended because of this order. 

Homeland Security announced Saturday it is suspending the implementation of President Donald Trump&#x27;s executive order that bans foreigners from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. The move comes as the State Department also said it has reinstated visas for those foreigners - backing up a federal judge who blocked Trump&#x27;s order Friday.
