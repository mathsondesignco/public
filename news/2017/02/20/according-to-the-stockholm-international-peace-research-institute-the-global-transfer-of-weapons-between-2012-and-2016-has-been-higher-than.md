# According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the global transfer of weapons between 2012 and 2016 has been higher than any other five-year period since the end of the Cold War, with the Middle East increasing its weapon imports by 212%, second only to India, who accounted for 13% of the world's imports. 

Middle East almost doubles weapons imports, as US and Europe remain the main suppliers and China joins top-tier exporters
