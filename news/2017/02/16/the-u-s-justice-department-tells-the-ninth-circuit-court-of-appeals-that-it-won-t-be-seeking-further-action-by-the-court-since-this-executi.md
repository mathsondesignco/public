# The U.S. Justice Department tells the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that it won't be seeking further action by the court since this executive order will soon be replaced by a different one. Justice added they expect the Ninth Circuit ruling will be vacated once the new executive order is issued. 

The DOJ told a federal court Thursday that there&#x27;s no point in further court battles over President Trump&#x27;s executive order on immigration.
