# A report by Amnesty International states that between 5,000 and 13,000 people, most of them civilians, were hanged at the military-run Sednaya Prison near Damascus between September 2011 and December 2015. 

Civilians killed and multi-storey buildings collapse in some of the heaviest strikes to hit rebel-held city in months.
