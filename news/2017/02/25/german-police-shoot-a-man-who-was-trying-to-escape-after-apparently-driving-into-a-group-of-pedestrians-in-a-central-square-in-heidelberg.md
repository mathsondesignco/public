# German police shoot a man, who was trying to escape after apparently driving into a group of pedestrians in a central square in Heidelberg. A 73-year-old man was killed and two other people injured. Police do not believe terrorism is involved. 

One man has died from his injuries and two others were injured after being struck by a car in Heidelberg. The knife-wielding driver was intercepted by a police patrol and shot by an officer following a brief standoff.
