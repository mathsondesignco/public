# U.S. President Donald Trump will recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, senior administration officials have said. This backs an Israel claim of controlling the entire city as its indivisible capital. The expected move of the United States embassy would set a precedent. 

The announcement would change decades of US foreign policy and has alarmed many Muslim countries.
