# U.S. President Donald Trump announces that the U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as the indivisible capital of Israel (which backs an Israeli claim of controlling the entire city as its indivisible capital), and will start the process of moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The move of the United States embassy would set a precedent. 

The announcement would change decades of US foreign policy and has alarmed many Muslim countries.
