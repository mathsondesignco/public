# Beate Uhse AG, supplier of the "Pabo" erotica catalog, files for bankruptcy in Germany. Only the holding company restructures in order to secure refinancing with the creditors. Beate Uhse-Rotermund opened the first sex shop in 1962, in Flensburg, under the name "Institut fur Ehehygiene" ("Institute for marriage hygiene"). 

Germany-based sex shop chain Beate Uhse AG says its holding company is filing for bankruptcy restructuring after failing to raise financing from investors and restructure its debts.
