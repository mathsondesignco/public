[The journal "Genes & Development" publishes research from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in a mouse-model study (which may translate over to humans) alluding as to why hair turns gray and goes bald. The scientists describe a protein called KROX20 which switches on skin cells that become a hair shaft, which then causes cells to produce another protein called stem cell factor. In mice, these two proteins are important for baldness and graying. ](/news/2017/05/8/the-journal-genes-development-publishes-research-from-the-university-of-texas-southwestern-medical-center-in-a-mouse-model-study-which.md) _Context: protein_

At least 10 percent of women of reproductive age suffer from endometriosis (endo) says Dr. Stacey Missmer of Brigham and Women's Hospital, who co-authored the study. ](/news/2016/03/29/new-research-published-in-circulation-cardiovascular-quality-and-outcomes-finds-women-who-have-endometriosis-the-abnormal-growth-of-ut.md) _Context: motherwomb_

The vast majority had a mosaic. ](/news/2015/12/1/a-study-published-in-the-proceedings-of-the-national-academy-of-sciences-on-gender-identity-reports-brains-do-not-really-fit-into-male-o.md) _Context: brain_
