# The Supreme Court of Justice of Guatemala leaves without effect the use of a manual used by the Procuratorate of Human Rights for talks and workshops about sexuality, due to the interpretation given to the document on the promotion of abortion, that, except risk to the mother's life, is unlegal in the country.
