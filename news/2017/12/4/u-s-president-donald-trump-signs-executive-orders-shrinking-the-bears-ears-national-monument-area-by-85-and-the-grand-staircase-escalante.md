# U.S. President Donald Trump signs executive orders shrinking the Bears Ears National Monument area by 85% and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by half. The controversial move is pitched as a win for state's rights versus the federal government but opponents see it as an example of the federal government breaking promises to Native American tribes and eroding protections for public land. 

Capping months of speculation, President Trump on Monday signed a pair of executive orders to significantly shrink two of Utah’s national monuments – Bears Ears and the Grand Staircase-Escalante – that were created by his Democratic predecessors.
