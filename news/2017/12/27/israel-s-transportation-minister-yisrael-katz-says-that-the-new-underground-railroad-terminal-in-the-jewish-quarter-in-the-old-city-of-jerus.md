# Israel's Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz says that the new underground railroad terminal in the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem (part of Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem) will be named in honor of U.S. President Donald Trump. 

&quot;The Western Wall is the holiest place for the Jewish people, and I decided to call the train station that leads to it after President Trump.&quot;
