# Belgium's biggest government party says that it will not accept the energy transition agreement in the form that was reached by the four ministers of energy on December 11. They cite mainly financial arguments, while the pact's negotiators say the cost is known. Prime Minister Charles Michel remains absent from Parliament. The process is inspired by the Energiewende in Germany.
