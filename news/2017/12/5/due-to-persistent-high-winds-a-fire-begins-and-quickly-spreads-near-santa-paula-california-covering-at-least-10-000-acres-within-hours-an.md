# Due to persistent high winds, a fire begins and quickly spreads near Santa Paula, California, covering at least 10,000 acres within hours and cutting power to 260,000 homes. 

A fast-moving, wind-fueled brush fire has burned about 10,000 acres in the foothills near Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, officials said.
