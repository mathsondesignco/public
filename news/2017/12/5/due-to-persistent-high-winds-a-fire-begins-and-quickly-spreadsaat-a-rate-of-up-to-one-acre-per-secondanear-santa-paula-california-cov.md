# Due to persistent high winds, a fire begins and quickly spreads--at a rate of up to one acre per second--near Santa Paula, California, covering now at least 50,000 acres, crawling into the edges of Ventura and cutting power to 260,000 homes. 7,700 houses are under mandatory evacuation. 

A fast-moving, wind-fueled brush fire has burned about 10,000 acres in the foothills near Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, officials said.
