# Russia names Voice of America, Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty and seven affiliated news media as foreign agents. This is in retaliation to the U.S. Justice Department requiring Russia Today to register as a foreign agent. 

The move comes in retaliation for U.S. actions against the RT news network.
