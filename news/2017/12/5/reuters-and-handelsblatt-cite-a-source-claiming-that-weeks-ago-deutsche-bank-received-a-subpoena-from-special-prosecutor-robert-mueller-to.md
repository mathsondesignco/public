# Reuters and Handelsblatt cite a source claiming that, weeks ago, Deutsche Bank received a subpoena from special prosecutor Robert Mueller to turn over Donald Trump's personal banking information. 

Special counsel Robert Mueller has asked Deutsche Bank to share data on the US president&#39;s business dealings, as his investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election widens.
