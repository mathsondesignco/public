# Houthis say that they launched a Volcano H-2 missile targeting at the Al-Yamamah Palace in the Saudi capital city of Riyadh. According to the Saudis, the missile was intercepted south of Riyadh and caused no casualties. 

Saudi Arabia intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Yemenâ€™s Houthi rebels over its capital city Tuesday, the second such incident in two months and another potential flashpoint in the volatile Saudi-Iranian relationship.
