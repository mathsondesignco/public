# The United Nations General Assembly voted 128-9, with 35 abstentions, in a nonbinding resolution to demand the United States to rescind its December 6th declaration on unilaterally recognizing the holy and contested city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. 

The vote amounted to a collective act of defiance toward the Trump administration at the United Nations, the worldâ€™s biggest diplomatic stage.
