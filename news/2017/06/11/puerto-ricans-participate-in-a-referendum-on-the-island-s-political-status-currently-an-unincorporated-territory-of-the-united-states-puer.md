# Puerto Ricans participate in a referendum on the island's political status. Currently an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico held a similar vote in 2012, in which a majority of voters opted for statehood, but this was rejected by the United States Congress due to a high number of blank ballots. 

Puerto Ricans head to the polls on Sunday to decide whether they want their struggling U.S. territory to become the 51st U.S. state, although a vote in favor would likely face an uphill battle in Congress and with President Donald Trump.
