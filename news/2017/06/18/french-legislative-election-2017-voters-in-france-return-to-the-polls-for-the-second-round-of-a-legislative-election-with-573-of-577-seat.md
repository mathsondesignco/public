# French legislative election, 2017: Voters in France return to the polls for the second round of a legislative election, with 573 of 577 seats in the National Assembly yet to be decided after the first round. 

The French are voting Sunday for the fourth time in two months and the main outstanding question is just how big a majority they will hand President Emmanuel Macron.
