# ISIL militants reportedly blow up the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi famously proclaimed the creation of a caliphate in 2014. ISIL blames a U.S. airstrike as a cover up. 

The al-Nuri Mosque was where the leader of IS proclaimed its so-called &quot;caliphate&quot; in 2014.
