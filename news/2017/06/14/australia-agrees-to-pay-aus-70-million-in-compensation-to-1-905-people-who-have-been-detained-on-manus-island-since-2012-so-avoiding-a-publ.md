# Australia agrees to pay AUS$70 million in compensation to 1,905 people who have been detained on Manus Island since 2012, so avoiding a public trial against the government and the Transfield and G4S private companies for the detainees' degrading and cruel treatment. 

Detainees at an Australian asylum-seeker camp in Papua New Guinea won millions of dollars in compensation for &quot;degrading and cruel&quot; treatment Wednesday, in a decision hailed as an important human rights victory.
