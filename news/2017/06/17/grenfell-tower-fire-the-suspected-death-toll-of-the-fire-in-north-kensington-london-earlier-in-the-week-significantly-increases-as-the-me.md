# Grenfell Tower fire: The suspected death toll of the fire in North Kensington, London earlier in the week significantly increases, as the Metropolitan Police Service reports that a minimum of 58 people are missing and feared dead. 

The official response to the Grenfell Tower catastrophe &ldquo;was not good enough&rdquo;, the Prime Minister admitted last night as the death toll exceeded that of Britain&rsquo;s worst fires since the war.
