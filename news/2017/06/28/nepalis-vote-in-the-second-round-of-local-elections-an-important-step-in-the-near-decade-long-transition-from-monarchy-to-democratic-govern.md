# Nepalis vote in the second round of local elections, an important step in the near decade-long transition from monarchy to democratic government.

Nepalis began voting in the second round of local elections on Wednesday, a key step towards holding a general election later this year that would complete a near decade-long democratic transition after the abolition of its monarchy.
