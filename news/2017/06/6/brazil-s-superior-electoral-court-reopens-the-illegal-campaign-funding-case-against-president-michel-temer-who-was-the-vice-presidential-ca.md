# Brazil's Superior Electoral Court reopens the illegal campaign funding case against President Michel Temer, who was the vice presidential candidate on former President Dilma Rousseff's ticket in 2014. Temer became president in August 2016 when Rousseff was impeached, and could be unseated if the court annuls the Rousseff-Temer election victory. 

Bras√≠lia (AFP) - Judges on Brazil&amp;#39;s electoral court were expected to start voting Wednesday in a case that could topple scandal-tainted President Michel Temer.
