# Results of yesterday's snap election are counted, revealing a hung parliament as the Conservative Party fails to retain its parliamentary majority, despite remaining the party with the most seats. Prime Minister Theresa May announced that she will form a minority government with the support of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party. 

Theresa May will visit Buckingham Palace to seek to form a government with backing from the DUP, after losing her Commons majority.
