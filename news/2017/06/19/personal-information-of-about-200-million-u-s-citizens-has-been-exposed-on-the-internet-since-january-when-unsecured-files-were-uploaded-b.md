#  Personal information of about 200 million U.S. citizens has been exposed on the Internet since January when unsecured files were uploaded by Republican contractor Deep Root Analytics. The data, available via publicly accessible providers such as Amazon Web Services, included birth dates, home addresses, telephone numbers, religious affiliations, ethnicities, and political views. The problem was discovered by an UpGuard analyst. 

Sensitive personal details were available on a cloud server to anyone with the correct link.
