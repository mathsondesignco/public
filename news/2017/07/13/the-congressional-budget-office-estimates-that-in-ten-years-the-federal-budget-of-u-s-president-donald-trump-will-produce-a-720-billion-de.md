# The Congressional Budget Office estimates that in ten years the federal budget of U.S. President Donald Trump will produce a $720 billion deficit rather than a $16 billion surplus as claimed by the Trump administration. 

President Donald Trump’s proposed budget wouldn’t balance within 10 years, contrary to the White House’s claim, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Thursday.
