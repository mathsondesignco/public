# A shrinking glacier in Switzerland has revealed two frozen bodies believed to be of a couple who went missing in 1942 and had never been found, despite extensive searches. Swiss authorities said that a DNA test will be conducted in several days' time. 

Their 79-year-old daughter says she has found peace from the discovery after a life-long search.
