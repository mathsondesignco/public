# Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully teleport a photon from a ground station in Tibet to a satellite orbiting Earth at distance of 500km away. It is the first time an object has been teleported from the planet into space. 

Researchers in China have teleported a photon from the ground to a satellite orbiting more than 500 kilometers above.
