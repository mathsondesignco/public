# Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 2017 Temple Mount crisis. The Israeli government says it will remove metal detectors and some cameras recently installed at the entrances to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem that resulted in a wave of protests and some deaths. Instead, less obtrusive surveillance means will be used. 

After days of violent protests and a diplomatic crisis with Jordan over the placement of metal detectors at the entrances to the Aqsa Compound, the Israeli government said it would remove them.
