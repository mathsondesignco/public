# Microsoft reneges on its decision to end its Paint program and would instead place it on the app store. 

Microsoft will not kill of Paint, it has now said. A suggestion from the company that it would &quot;deprecate&quot; the app and may remove it from future versions of Windows provoke rage, sadness and nostalgia among almost everyone on the internet when it was announced. But Microsoft has now made clear that it will be sticking around â€“ albeit in a different form.
