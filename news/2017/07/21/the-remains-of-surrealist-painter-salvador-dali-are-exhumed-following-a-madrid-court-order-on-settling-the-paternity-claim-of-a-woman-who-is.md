# The remains of surrealist painter Salvador Dal are exhumed following a Madrid court order on settling the paternity claim of a woman who is allegedly the painter's natural daughter. Various experts contest the claim, ranging from Dal's sexual eccentrism (including a public boast about his "impotency") to the action being against the state (Dal bequeathed his estate to Spain). If proven, his daughter could assume part of Dal's estate.
