# The remains of surrealist painter Salvador Dali are exhumed following a Madrid court order on settling the paternity claim of a woman who is allegedly the painter's natural daughter. Various experts contest the claim, ranging from Dali's sexual eccentrism (including a public boast about his "impotency") to the action being against the state (Dali bequeathed his estate to Spain). If proven, his daughter could assume part of Dali's estate.
