# Nobel Peace Laureate Liu Xiaobo, who has been incarcerated in China for organizing the pro-democracy manifesto "Charter 08," is suffering from late-stage liver cancer which is worsening. The Chinese hospital treating him and foreign doctors, who examined Liu the weekend, disagree on future treatment. Germany, the United States, UK, and other countries have appealed that Liu be allowed to go to the hospital of his choice. 

Germany urged China on Wednesdayto allow Nobel Peace Prize-winning dissident Liu Xiaobo to leavethe country to receive medical treatment abroad after thehospital treating him said his condition was critical.
