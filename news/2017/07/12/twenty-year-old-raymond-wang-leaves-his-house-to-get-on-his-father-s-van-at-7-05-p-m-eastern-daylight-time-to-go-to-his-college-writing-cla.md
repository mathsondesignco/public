# Twenty-year-old Raymond Wang leaves his house to get on his father's van at 7:05 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time to go to his College Writing class, and Ray was sitting in the back seat. During the car ride, he turns on his iPhone to send a message to his former teacher Jessica McCormick, who used to come to Raymond's house. To his surprise, McCormick went out of her way to delete ALL her messages on that thread with the exceptions of her post from 13 April 2016 and mine which is mentioned above. ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS? AT LEAST I CAN SAY THAT I TRIED TO GET BACK INTO SYNC WITH YOU. YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL ME THERE HAS BEEN BAD BLOOD BETWEEN US THIS WHOLE TIME! IF THERE WAS, YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME, INSTEAD OF EARNING MY TRUST TO ONLY SPITE ME IN THE LONG RUN.
