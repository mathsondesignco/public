# Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales announces plans for a crowdfunded news website, "Wikitribune", that will publish stories by journalists, with contributions, including fact checking, by volunteers to, among other goals, counter the recent spread of so-called "fake news". 

Jimmy Wales said the new platform, Wikitribune, would be free to read and carry no advertising, instead relying on supporters to fund it.
