# The Gaza Strip's sole power plant is shut down due to running out of fuel, amid unpaid bills and a dispute over tax bills on fuel imports to the blockaded Palestinian territory. 

The only functioning power plant in the Palestinian territory is out of action after running out of fuel. The local electricity company blamed a &quot;dispute&quot; between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority for the outage.
