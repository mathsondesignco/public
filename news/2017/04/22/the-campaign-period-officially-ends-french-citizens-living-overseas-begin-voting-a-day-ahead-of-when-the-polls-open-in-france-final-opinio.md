# The campaign period officially ends. French citizens living overseas begin voting a day ahead of when the polls open in France. Final opinion polling gives Emmanuel Macron a slight lead over Marine Le Pen. Francois Fillon and Jean-Luc Melenchon are close behind. 

The final hours of campaigning for the French presidential elections have been overshadowed by the shooting of police in central Paris. A tightly-contested first round is expected among the four main candidates.
