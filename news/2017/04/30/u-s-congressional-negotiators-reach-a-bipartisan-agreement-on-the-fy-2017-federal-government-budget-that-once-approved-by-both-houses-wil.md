# U.S. Congressional negotiators reach a bipartisan agreement on the FY 2017 federal government budget that, once approved by both Houses, will fund the entire fiscal year through September 30. The current spending authorization expires  Friday, May 5. 

U.S. House and Senate negotiators reached a bipartisan deal on a $1.16 trillion spending bill that largely tracks with Democratic priorities and rejects most of President Donald Trumpâ€™s wish list, including money to begin building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.
