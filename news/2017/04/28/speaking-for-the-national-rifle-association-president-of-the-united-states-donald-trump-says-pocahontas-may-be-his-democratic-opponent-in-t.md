# Speaking for the National Rifle Association, President of the United States Donald Trump says Pocahontas may be his Democratic opponent in the 2020 United States presidential election, apparently referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren. 

President Donald Trump on Friday told the National Rifle Association&#x27;s leadership forum that &quot;the eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end.&quot; He then returned to one of his most derogatory campaign insults, referring to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as &quot;Pocahontas&quot; -- a jab at her Native American ancestry.
