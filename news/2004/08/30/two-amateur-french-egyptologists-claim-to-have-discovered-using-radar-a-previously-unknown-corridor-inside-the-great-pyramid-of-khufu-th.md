#  Two amateur French Egyptologists claim to have discovered, using radar, a previously unknown corridor inside the Great Pyramid of Khufu. They believe the corridor would lead directly to Khufu's burial chamber, a room which &ndash; if it exists &ndash; is unlikely to have been accessed since the burial and may still contain the king's remains.
