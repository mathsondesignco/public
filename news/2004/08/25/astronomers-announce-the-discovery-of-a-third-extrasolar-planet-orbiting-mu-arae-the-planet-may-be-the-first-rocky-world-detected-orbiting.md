[Scientists at Northumbria University in northeast England develop a computerized statistical model of the Sun's solar cycle (a measurement of the number of sunspots and solar flares, in this case between 1976 and 2008, and their intensity and activity). While preliminary, and not yet peer-reviewed, the data predicts irregularities in the cycle: the Northern Hemisphere could experience a slight lowering in temperatures in the 2030s. ](/news/2015/07/14/scientists-at-northumbria-university-in-northeast-england-develop-a-computerized-statistical-model-of-the-sun-s-solar-cycle-a-measurement-o.md) _Context: Sun_
