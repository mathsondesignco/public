#  Economists from Harvard and UNC - Chapel Hill determine that peer-to-peer file sharing and music downloads "have an effect on sales which is statistically indistinguishable from zero, despite rather precise estimates." 

Music industry, which leads drive against Internet file sharing of copyrighted work on premise that downloading hurts sales, reacts with flustered consternation to study by economists Felix Oberholzer-Gee and Koleman S Strumpf that found downloading has no impact on CD sales; study compared direct data of music downloaders with music purchases during same period; found spikes in downloading had almost no discernible effect on sales; Oberholzer-Gee says previous research wrongly assumed that every download could be thought of as lost sale, while most downloaders would not have paid for music, interview; graphs of recording releases, sales and downloading (M)
