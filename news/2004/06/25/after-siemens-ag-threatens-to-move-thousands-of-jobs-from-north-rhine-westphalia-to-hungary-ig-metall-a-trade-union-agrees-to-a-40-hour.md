#  After Siemens AG threatens to move thousands of jobs from North Rhine-Westphalia to Hungary, IG Metall (a trade union) agrees to a 40-hour work week for the same pay they currently receive for working 35. The agreement reduces by EUR5 the cost of each Siemens mobile phone manufactured under the new agreement. IG Metall workers had enjoyed the 35-hour work week since 1984.
