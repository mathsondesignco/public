#  Five aid workers representing Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) are killed in a Taliban ambush in north-western Afghanistan. The workers are one Dutchman, one Belgian, one Norwegian, and two Afghans. The incident leads MSF to temporarily suspend their activities nationwide, except for life-saving activities. 

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is an international, independent, medical humanitarian organisation.
