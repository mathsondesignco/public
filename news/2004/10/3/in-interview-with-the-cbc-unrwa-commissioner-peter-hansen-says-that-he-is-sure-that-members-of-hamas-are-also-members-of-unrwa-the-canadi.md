#  In interview with the CBC, UNRWA commissioner Peter Hansen says that he is sure that members of Hamas are also members of UNRWA. The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, which has designated Hamas a terrorist organization said it "will immediately seek clarification from Mr. Hansen directly and from UN authorities". 

Ottawa will look into the possibility that a United Nations agency Canada backs is connected with Hamas, a Palestinian militant group.
