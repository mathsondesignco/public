#  Cleanup work at Love Canal has been completed, federal officials said. The EPA says it should be taken off the Superfund list. Environmental activist Lois Gibbs said the Bush administration was seeking to deflect criticism from a March 11 Senate vote against reauthorizing an expired user fee on corporations to fund environmental cleanup. 

Federal officials say Love Canal section of Niagara Falls, NY, is clean enough to be removed from Superfund list of toxic waste sites; hundreds of families were evacuated from neighborhood in 1978 after deadly chemicals started oozing through ground into basements and a school, burning children and pets and, according to experts, causing birth defects and miscarriages; neighborhood was built on 19th-century canal where toxic mix of more than 80 industrial chemicals had been buried; Superfund delisting will be mostly symbolic since most of work on cleanup, which took 21 years and cost close to $400 million, was completed a few years ago; photos; map (L)
