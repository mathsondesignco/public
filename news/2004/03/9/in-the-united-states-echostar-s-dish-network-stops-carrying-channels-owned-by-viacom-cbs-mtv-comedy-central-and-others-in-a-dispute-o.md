#  In the United States, EchoStar's Dish Network stops carrying channels owned by Viacom (CBS, MTV, Comedy Central, and others) in a dispute over the pricing of those channels. Both companies have used text crawls and other information to influence viewers to call the opposing company to negotiate price. 

Negotiations over a new contract between the EchoStar and Viacom have failed to produce a new agreement, and early today EchoStar stopped broadcasting Viacom-owned CBS television stations.
