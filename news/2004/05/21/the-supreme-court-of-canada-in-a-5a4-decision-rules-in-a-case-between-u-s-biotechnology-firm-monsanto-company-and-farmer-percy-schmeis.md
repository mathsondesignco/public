#  The Supreme Court of Canada, in a 5-4 decision, rules in a case between U.S. biotechnology firm Monsanto Company and farmer Percy Schmeiser that Monsanto holds a patent on the Roundup Ready gene inserted in its canola seed and can control the use of the plant. The court previously decided that a higher life form, the Harvard mouse, could not be patented.
