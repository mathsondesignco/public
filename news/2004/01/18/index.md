### [ Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon praises the Israeli ambassador to Sweden, Zvi Mazel, for vandalising the artwork entitled "Snow White and The Madness of Truth" displayed at a Stockholm museum. The piece, created by an Israeli-born composer-musician, consists of a white float carrying a picture of a Palestinian suicide bomber in a pool of blood-coloured water.
