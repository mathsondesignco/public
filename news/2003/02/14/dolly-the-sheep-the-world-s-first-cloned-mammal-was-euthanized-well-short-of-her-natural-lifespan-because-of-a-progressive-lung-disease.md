[Sun Yat-sen University research published in the journal "Protein & Cell" describes using gene therapy in the removal of a version of the inherited blood disorder beta-thalassemia from an artificially-created nuclear transfer-type of cloning-model system of human oocytes. Collectively, this study demonstrated the feasibility of curing this and a range of other inherited diseases using the same genome editing technology of CRISPR. ](/news/2017/09/29/sun-yat-sen-university-research-published-in-the-journal-protein-cell-describes-using-gene-therapy-in-the-removal-of-a-version-of-the-in.md) _Context: cloning_
