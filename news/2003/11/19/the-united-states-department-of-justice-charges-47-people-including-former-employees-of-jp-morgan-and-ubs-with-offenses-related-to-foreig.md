#  The United States Department of Justice charges 47 people, including former employees of JP Morgan and UBS, with offenses related to foreign exchange fraud. At the same time investigations into fraud in the US mutual fund industry widen. The U.S. House of Representatives approves a draft bill that explicitly bans some of the troublesome mutual fund practices. Some commentators think these various financial scandals are undermining the US dollar, which falls to an all-time low against the euro.
