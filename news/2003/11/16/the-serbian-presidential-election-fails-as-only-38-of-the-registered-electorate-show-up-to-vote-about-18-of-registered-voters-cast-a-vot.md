#  The Serbian presidential election fails as only 38% of the registered electorate show up to vote. About 18% of registered voters cast a vote for Tomislav Nikolic, 14% for Dragoljub Micunovic, 4% for Velimir Ilic, and 3% for other candidates. With a turnout of less than 50%, the poll is declared invalid.
