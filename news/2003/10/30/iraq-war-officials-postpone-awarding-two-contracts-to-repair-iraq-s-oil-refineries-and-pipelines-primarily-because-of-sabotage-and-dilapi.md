#  Iraq War: Officials postpone awarding two contracts to repair Iraq's oil refineries and pipelines (primarily because of sabotage and dilapidated conditions). An investigation has been started on the high price that the United States is paying to Kellogg Brown & Root for oil imported from Kuwait. The Center for Public Integrity says that firms awarded contracts in Iraq have tended to be big donors (in the past) to the Republican Party. The UN announces that it is withdrawing its remaining international staff from Baghdad, perhaps temporarily.
