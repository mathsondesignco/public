### [ Iraq and weapons of mass destruction: The world continues to digest David Kay's report that finds very little evidence of Weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, although the regime did intend to develop more weapons with additional capabilities. Such plans and programs appear to have been dormant, the existence of these were also concealed from the United Nations during the inspections that began in 2002.

The US-sponsored search for WMD has so far cost $300 million and is projected to cost around $600 million more.](/news/2003/10/3/iraq-and-weapons-of-mass-destruction-the-world-continues-to-digest-david-kay-s-report-that-finds-very-little-evidence-of-weapons-of-mass-d.md)

### [ Polish soldiers of the United States-led Coalition discovered four advanced missiles around central Iraq in the Hilla region near a highway. The Roland-type French-made missiles (which are fired from a mobile launcher vehicle against low flying aircraft) were initially believed to have been manufactured earlier in 2003. Arms exports to Iraq had been barred by the United Nations after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. France says it last shipped Roland missiles to Iraq in 1986. The Polish soldiers were later found to have misinterpreted markings that read 07-01-KND 2003 as a date on the missiles. url=http:--www.reuters.com-newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=3558401 title=Breaking News, Top News & Latest News Headlines - Reuters.com December 2015 ](/news/2003/10/3/polish-soldiers-of-the-united-states-led-coalition-discovered-four-advanced-missiles-around-central-iraq-in-the-hilla-region-near-a-highway.md)
