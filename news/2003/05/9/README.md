### [ The United States House of Representatives approves a tax-cut measure for $550 billion over 10 years. This is $176 billion less than President George W. Bush originally proposed, but $200 billion more than the Senate's version of the same measure. One highly controversial aspect of the President's initial proposal that the House removed is the repeal of the tax on dividends paid by corporations to shareholders. There are also important differences between the House and Senate bills, and great difficulty is foreseen in reconciling them before they may be sent to the President for approval.](/news/2003/05/9/the-united-states-house-of-representatives-approves-a-tax-cut-measure-for-550-billion-over-10-years-this-is-176-billion-less-than-presid.md)
