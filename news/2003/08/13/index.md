### [ Ivan Jovovic and Bogdan Bukomiric, both 16 years old, from Gorazdevac near Pec die after two attackers fired AK-47s on a group of children from Gorazdevac who were bathing in the river Bistrica. Four children were injured in the attack, two of which are in critical condition. UNMIK and KFOR claimed that they transferred one of them, Marko Bogicevic, to Belgrade, but he is actually in a German military hospital at Prizren, against his parents' wishes. An Italian KFOR patrol refused to lend fuel for the car which was transporting wounded children to hospital in Pec, when it ran out of fuel, and took no action when car was stoned by local Albanians. After finally arriving at Pec, doctors there refused to treat the children. KFOR claims that it is researching the location of the incident with 300 men.date=February 2010](/news/2003/08/13/ivan-jovovic-and-bogdan-bukomiric-both-16-years-old-from-goraa3-4devac-near-pec-die-after-two-attackers-fired-ak-47s-on-a-group-of-children.md)
