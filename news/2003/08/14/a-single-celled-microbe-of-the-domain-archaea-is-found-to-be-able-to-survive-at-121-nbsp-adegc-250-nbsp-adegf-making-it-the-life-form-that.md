#  A single-celled microbe, of the domain Archaea, is found to be able to survive at 121&nbsp;degC (250&nbsp;degF), making it the life form that can tolerate the highest temperature. The microbe, temporarily named "Strain 121", which was found 200 mi away from Puget Sound in a hydrothermal vent, may provide clues to when and where life first evolved on Earth. It metabolizes by reducing iron oxide.

In mice, these two proteins are important for baldness and graying. ](/news/2017/05/8/the-journal-genes-development-publishes-research-from-the-university-of-texas-southwestern-medical-center-in-a-mouse-model-study-which.md) _Context: cells_
