#  Separation of church and state: The controversial "Ten Commandments" monument in Alabama's Supreme Court building is removed from public view, following a court order stating that the monument's location in the court building breaches the separation of church and state. The monument, nicknamed "Roy's Holy Rock", was installed two years ago by the conservative Christian Chief Justice Roy Moore. Only one in five (20%) Americans approve of the federal court order under which workers removed the "Ten Commandments" monument from the rotunda of Alabama's state judicial building Wednesday, according to a new poll.
