1. [Astronomers say they have observed bizarre light patterns using the Kepler Space Telescope from a star that appears old, but is shrouded in debris like a much younger star, roughly 1,500 light-years away. This has led to speculation that these are an "artificial extraterrestrial mega-structure", orbiting the star known as KIC 8462852 in the Cygnus constellation. KIC 8462852 lies just above the Milky Way between the constellations Cygnus and Lyra. It first attracted the attention of astronomers in 2009 when the Kepler Space Telescope identified it as a candidate for having orbiting Earth-like planets. ](/news/2015/10/15/astronomers-say-they-have-observed-bizarre-light-patterns-using-the-kepler-space-telescope-from-a-star-that-appears-old-but-is-shrouded-in.md) _Context: Astronomers_
