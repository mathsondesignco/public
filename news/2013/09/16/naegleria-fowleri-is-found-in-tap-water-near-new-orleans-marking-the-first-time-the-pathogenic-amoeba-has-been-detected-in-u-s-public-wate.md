# Naegleria fowleri is found in tap water near New Orleans, marking the first time the pathogenic amoeba has been detected in U.S. public water supply. 

A deadly brain amoeba thatâ€™s killed two boys this year has been found in a U.S. drinking water supply system for the first time, officials said Monday -- in a New Orleans-area system. The Naegleria fowleri parasite killed a 4-year-old Mississippi boy who likely got it playing on a back yard Slip &#x27;N Slide, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials say.
