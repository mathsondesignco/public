# Kenyan general election, 2013: Early returns show that Uhuru Kenyatta has taken a lead in the presidential election. 

Kenyan authorities hope to deliver the final outcome of a presidential vote on Wednesday, after partial results showed a lead for a politician wanted in the Hague over tribal violence at the last election five years ago.
