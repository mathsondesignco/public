# Papal conclave, 2013: Black smoke rises from the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, signalling that Roman Catholic Cardinals had not elected a new pope in the morning session of the second day of voting at their conclave. 

Catholic cardinals meeting at the Vatican have been holding another round of voting to choose a new Pope, but there is no sign of a positive result.
