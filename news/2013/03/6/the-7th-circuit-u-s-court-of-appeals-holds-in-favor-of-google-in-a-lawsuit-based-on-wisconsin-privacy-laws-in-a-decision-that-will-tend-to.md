# The 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals holds in favor of Google in a lawsuit based on Wisconsin privacy laws in a decision that will tend to protect the vendors of search engines from those who object to the unwholesome responses they get when entering a vanity search. 

A Wisconsin woman trying to protect her &quot;wholesome&quot; image failed to persuade a federal appeals court to hold Google Inc liable because searches for her name could lead people to advertisements for drugs to treat sexual dysfunction.
