# 2013 Korean crisis: North Korea declares it is in a state of war with South Korea, and will conduct any further dealings under "wartime regulations". Russia urges calm on both sides. North Korea threatens to shut down the industrial plant in Kaesong, on the border with South Korea. 

North Korea said on Saturday it was entering a &quot;state of war&quot; with South Korea, but Seoul and its ally the United States played down the statement as tough talk.
