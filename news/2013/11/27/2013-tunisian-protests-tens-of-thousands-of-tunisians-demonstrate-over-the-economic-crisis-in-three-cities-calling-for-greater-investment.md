# 2013 Tunisian protests:. Tens of thousands of Tunisians demonstrate over the economic crisis in three cities calling for greater investment in their impoverished regions. Clashes broke out in the town of Siliana between the police and protesters following general strikes. 

Angry protesters set fire to the office of Tunisia&#39;s ruling Islamist party in the neglected Gafsa region, as strikes are observed in areas amid rising discontent and political deadlock.
