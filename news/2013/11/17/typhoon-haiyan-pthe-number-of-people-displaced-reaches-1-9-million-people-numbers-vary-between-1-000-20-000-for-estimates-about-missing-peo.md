# Typhoon Haiyan:The number of people displaced reaches 1.9 million people. Numbers vary between 1,000-20,000 for estimates about missing people. 

Flooding in Vietnam has killed at least 28 people since Friday, with nine others missing and nearly 80,000 displaced, state media and government reports said, after a tropical depression dumped heavy rains across central regions of the country.
