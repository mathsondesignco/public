# The Egyptian Army is dispatched to the town of Suez following the death of at least nine people in clashes between anti-government protesters and supporters of President Mohamed Morsi. 

At least 32 people were killed on Saturday when Egyptians rampaged in protest at the sentencing of 21 people to death over a soccer stadium disaster, violence that compounds a political crisis facing Islamist President Mohamed Mursi.
