# In baseball, no candidates were elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for the first time since 1996, with some candidates such as Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens performing poorly due to allegations of steroid use. 

In the most resounding referendum yet on the legacy of steroids in baseball, voters for the Hall of Fame emphatically rejected the candidacies of Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens in balloting results announced Wednesday.
