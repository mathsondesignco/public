# NASA scientists beam a picture of Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece, the "Mona Lisa", to Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, a spacecraft orbiting the Moon, marking a first in laser communication. 

NASA beamed an image of the Mona Lisa to the LRO spacecraft as part of the first demo of laser communication with a satellite at the moon.
