# Voters in Argentina go to the polls for mid-term elections, where races for one third of the Senate and half the Chamber of Deputies will be decided. The governing Front for Victory maintained an absloute majority in both chambers (adding one Senator and five Deputies); but the new Renewal Front won by 12% in the largest district, the Province of Buenos Aires. 

A strong showing by the Renewal Front party suggested a vulnerability in the long tenure of the family of President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner.
