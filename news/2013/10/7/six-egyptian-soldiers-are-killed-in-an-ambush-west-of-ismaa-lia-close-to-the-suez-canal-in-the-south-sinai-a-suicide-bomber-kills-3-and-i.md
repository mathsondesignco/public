# Six Egyptian soldiers are killed in an ambush west of Ismailia, close to the Suez Canal. In the South Sinai, a suicide bomber kills 3 and injures 55 others after an attack against security buildings in the provincial capital El-Tor. 

Suspected militants killed six Egyptian soldiers near the Suez Canal and fired rocket-propelled grenades at a state satellite station in Cairo on Monday, suggesting an Islamist insurgency was gathering pace three months after an army takeover.
