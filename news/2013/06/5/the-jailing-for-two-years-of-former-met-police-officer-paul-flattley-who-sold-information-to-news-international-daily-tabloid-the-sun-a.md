# The jailing for two years of former Met Police officer Paul Flattley, who sold information to News International daily tabloid ''The Sun'' about Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Paul Gascoigne and a 15-year-old girl who died of an overdose, is revealed for the first time today, "legal reasons" having prevented its disclosure until now. 

A convicted Scotland Yard constable awarded a coveted &quot;baton of honour&quot; during his training, but who went on to sell the Sun newspaper front-page secrets including the imminent proposal of Prince William to Kate Middleton, can be named today after legal restrictions were lifted in Southwark Crown Court.
