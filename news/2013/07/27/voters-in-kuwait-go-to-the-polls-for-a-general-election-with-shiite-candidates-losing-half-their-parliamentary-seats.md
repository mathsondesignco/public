# Voters in Kuwait go to the polls for a general election, with Shiite candidates losing half their parliamentary seats. 

Kuwait&#039;s Shi&#039;ite minority lost more than half of their seats and liberals made slight gains in the Gulf state&#039;s second polls in eight months, in a major blow to radicals.
