# U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announces her resignation to become the President of the University of California. 

Janet Napolitano , the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security and former governor of Arizona, is being named as the next president of the University of California system, in an unusual choice that brings a national-level politician to a position usually held by an academic, The Times has learned.
