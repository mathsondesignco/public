6. [The Associated Press reports that Russia's crackdown on Muslims is fueling their exodus to ISIS.  For example, Russia's southernmost republic of Dagestan keeps devout Muslims under surveillance, routinely raids their homes, and hauls them to police stations to give DNA samples and fingerprints. Regional police say nearly a third of the estimated 3,000 Russians who are believed to have gone to fight alongside IS militants in Syria are from Dagestan. The AP added, "Few efforts are made by Russian authorities to stop young men from leaving." ](/news/2015/11/25/the-associated-press-reports-that-russia-s-crackdown-on-muslims-is-fueling-their-exodus-to-isis-for-example-russia-s-southernmost-republi.md) _Context: Dagestan, Russia_
