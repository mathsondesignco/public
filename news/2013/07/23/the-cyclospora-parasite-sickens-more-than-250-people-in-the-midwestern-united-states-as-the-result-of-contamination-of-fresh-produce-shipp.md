# The "Cyclospora" parasite sickens more than 250 people in the Midwestern United States as the result of contamination of fresh produce shipped across state lines. The CDC report that eight people have been hospitalized with cyclosporiasis. 

More than 250 people have been sickened, mostly in the Midwest, by a rare parasite that may have contaminated fresh produce shipped across state lines, said federal health officials, whoâ€™ve stepped in to help coordinate the growing outbreak. At least 118 cases of cyclospora infection have been reported in Iowa, another 65 in Texas and 68 in Nebraska, state officials said.
