# 2013 Egyptian coup d'etat:. Egypt's military deposes President Mohamed Morsi, and installs Adly Mansour, the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court, as the country's new interim leader. 

Mohamed Morsi rejected a military ultimatum to strike a deal with his opponents tonight and declared himself Egypt’s legitimate leader – despite the eruption in Cairo of deadly gun battles during rallies to shore up his teetering position.
