# Portuguese political crisis, 2013: The President of Portugal Cavaco Silva calls for a national salvation understanding between the three main parties: the Socialists, and the governing coalition PSD and CDS-PP. In a statement after the President's communication to the country, the Socialists said they will not support such Government and called for early elections. 

President Anibal Cavaco Silva proposed an urgent cross-party agreement between the ruling coalition and opposition Socialists on Wednesday to ensure Portugal can complete adjustments under a bailout by June 2014 before holding early elections.
