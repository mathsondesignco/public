# Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera states that the country has lodged a protest with China after a People's Liberation Army Navy frigate directed weapon-targeting radar at a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer near the disputed Senkaku Islands. 

A Chinese vessel locked its weapon-targeting radar on a Japanese ship near disputed islands, Tokyo says, amid mounting tensions over a territorial row.
