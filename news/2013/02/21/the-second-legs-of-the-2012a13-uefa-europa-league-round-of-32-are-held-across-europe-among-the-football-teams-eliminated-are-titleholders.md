# The second legs of the 2012-13 UEFA Europa League round of 32 are held across Europe. Among the football teams eliminated are titleholders Atletico Madrid, Ajax (in the first ever penalty shootout in the knockout phase of the competition) and European giants Liverpool, while both London sides left, Tottenham and Chelsea, advance into the last 16. 

While Chelsea FC and Tottenham Hotspur FC struck at the death, Liverpool FC and holders Club Atl&#233;tico de Madrid fell just short and AFC Ajax went out in historic fashion.
