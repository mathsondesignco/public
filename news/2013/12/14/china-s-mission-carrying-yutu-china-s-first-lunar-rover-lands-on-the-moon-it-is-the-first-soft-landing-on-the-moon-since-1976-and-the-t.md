# China's mission carrying Yutu, China's first lunar rover, lands on the Moon. It is the first "soft" landing on the Moon since 1976 and the third ever robotic rover. 

China landed an unmanned spacecraft on the moon on Saturday, state media reported, in the first such &quot;soft-landing&quot; since 1976, joining the United States and the former Soviet Union in managing to accomplish such a feat.
