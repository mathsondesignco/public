# Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in New York City have found that a modified version of the leukemia treatment radioimmunotherapy can kill latent HIV cells, possibly providing a cure for one of the world's deadliest diseases. 

A radioactive smart bomb might help mop up the last bits of AIDS virus hiding out in a patientâ€™s body, even getting into the brain, researchers reported Tuesday.The approach is part of a new effort to try to cure AIDS. After 30 years of fighting the deadly and incurable virus, scientists think they may be able to find a way to really kill it.
