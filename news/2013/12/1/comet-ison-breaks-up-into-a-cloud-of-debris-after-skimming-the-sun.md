# Comet ISON breaks up into a cloud of debris after skimming the Sun. 

Previous reports of Comet ISON&#x27;s death may have been somewhat exaggerated, but this time it looks like the real thing.Remnants of the object once touted as the &quot;comet of the century&quot; passed through the viewing field of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory in the wake of Thursday&#x27;s close encounter with the sun â€” and as it passed, the bright spot that survived grew dimmer and dimmer.
