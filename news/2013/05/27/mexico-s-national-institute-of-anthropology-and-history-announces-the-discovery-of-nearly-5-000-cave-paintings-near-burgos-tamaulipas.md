# Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History announces the discovery of nearly 5,000 cave paintings near Burgos, Tamaulipas. 

Archaeologists have uncovered nearly 5,000 cave paintings at 11 different sites in Mexico, the likely product of early hunter-gatherers. Whatâ€™s even more remarkable is that the area was previously thought to be uninhabited.
