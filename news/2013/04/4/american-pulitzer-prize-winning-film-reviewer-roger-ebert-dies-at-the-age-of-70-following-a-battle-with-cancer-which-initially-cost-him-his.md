# American Pulitzer Prize-winning film reviewer Roger Ebert dies at the age of 70 following a battle with cancer which initially cost him his voice. 

Ebert had been the film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times since April 3, 1967. He battled cancer publicly, but still wrote more than 200 reviews a year for the paper.
