# U.S. President Donald Trump tweets Pakistan has been a safe haven for terrorists from Afghanistan and has given America nothing but lies and deceit after getting more than $33 billion U.S. aid. 

“The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies &amp; deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!”
