### [2018-01-8](/news/2018/01/8/index.md)

# The Trump administration will, in 18 months, end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from El Salvador living in the US under the TPS issued after a series of devastating earthquakes in 2001. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates about 200,000 Salvadorans will be impacted. 

Two hundred thousand people will be given 18 months to move out or find a legal way to remain.
