# Ultracompact dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1 is revealed to be the smallest known galaxy to have a supermassive black hole at its centre. 

A supermassive black hole has been spotted in the tiniest galaxy yet - an ultracompact dwarf galaxy - which suggests that black holes could be in places we haven&#039;t even thought to look yet.
