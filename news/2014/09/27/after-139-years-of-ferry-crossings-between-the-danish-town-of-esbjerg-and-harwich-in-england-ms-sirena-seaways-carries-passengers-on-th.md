# After 139 years of ferry crossings between the Danish town of Esbjerg and Harwich in England, {{MS|Sirena Seaways}} carries passengers on the route for the last time as DFDS closes the route due to "dwindling demand and high costs"; a freight service will still be available on the route from Esbjerg to Immingham. 

There has been big interest in the last Harwich-Esbjerg crossing from both guests and passengers. But the media is also showing a big interest too.
