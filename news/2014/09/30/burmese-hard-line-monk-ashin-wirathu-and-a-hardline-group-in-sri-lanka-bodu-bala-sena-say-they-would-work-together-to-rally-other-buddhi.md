# Burmese hard-line monk, Ashin Wirathu, and a hardline group in Sri Lanka, Bodu Bala Sena, say they would work together to rally other Buddhist groups and defend their faith against militant Islamists. 

A hard-line Buddhist monk from Myanmar known for his anti-Muslim stance said his movement would join hands with a like-minded Sri Lankan group to protect Buddhists, whom he called an endangered world minority.
