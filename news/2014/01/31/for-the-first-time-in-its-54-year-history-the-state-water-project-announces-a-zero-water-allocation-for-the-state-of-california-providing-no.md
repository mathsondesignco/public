# For the first time in its 54-year history the State Water Project announces a zero water allocation for the state of California providing no water to urban residents or farmers this year amid a record setting drought. 

Officials Friday said that for the first time ever, the State Water Project that helps supply a majority of Californians may be unable to make any deliveries except to maintain public health and safety.
