# Uruguay's star striker Luis Surez is expelled from the tournament, banned for nine international matches and suspended from all football-related activity for four months for biting Giorgio Chiellini of Italy in Tuesday's Group D match. The verdict, the most severe against any player in FIFA World Cup history, means Surez will be unable to play or train for his club Liverpool until 27 October. 

Liverpool are to ‘wait and see’ after Luis Suarez was handed a record nine-game international ban and a four-month suspension from all football for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chielli
