# 2014 Mosul offensive: Insurgents continue their offensive, gaining control of the city of Tikrit, the second provincial capital to fall in as many days. At least 500,000 residents of Mosul flee the fighting and head east into Kurdish-controlled territory, while insurgents storm the Turkish Embassy and take 48 Turks hostage, including the Consul General. 

Gunmen from the Islamic State of Iraq take city and launch attacks on Kirkuk and Samarra, a day after the fall of Mosul.
