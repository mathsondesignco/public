# Garda phone tapping scandal:Martin Callinan resigns as Commissioner of Ireland's Garda Siochana (national police) over his "disgusting" comment about whistleblowers made to a parliamentary committee. Callinan had also been involved in controversy over the recent surveillance/bugging of GSOC. 

The head of the Irish police force resigns following a controversy over whistleblowers, whose concerns about the motoring penalty points system appeared to be vindicated by an independent report.
