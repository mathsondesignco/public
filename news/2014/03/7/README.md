Staples Inc., the big office supply retailer trying to reinvent itself in the face of intense Internet competition, plans to close as many as 225 stores and slash $500 million in annual costs by the end of next year. The Framingham company has closed about 40 locations and shrunk the size of another 40 superstores in the past year. The more aggressive plans detailed Thursday came on the heels of disappointing sales results for the Christmas period and forecasts for more business declines in the immediate future. “Now I want to make it clear that we’re not getting out of the retail business,” Staples Chief Executive Ron Sargent said in a call with analysts. “That said, stores have to earn the right to stay open, and we are committed to making tough calls when it’s necessary.”
