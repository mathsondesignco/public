# With 13 votes for and 122 against, the European Parliament rejects former Slovenian Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek's candidacy for Vice-President of the European Commission and as Commissioner for the Energy Union. 

The withdrawal of the Slovenian commission candidate clears the way for a new nominee, but the Juncker team is still at risk of being delayed.
