Burwell''In a move designed to head off a 4-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court directs lawyers for the Obama administration, and for the religious groups who challenge it, to submit written briefs on a possible remedy to the case: whether coverage could be provided through the group's insurance companies without any actual notice to the government. A 4-4 decision would not set a national precedent, and would let stand the preceding decision in each case. In these seven cases, the appeals court in six upheld the government mandate. ](/news/2016/03/29/obamacare-constitutional-challenges-zubik-v-burwell-pin-a-move-designed-to-head-off-a-4-4-decision-the-u-s-supreme-court-directs-lawy.md) _Context: Obamacare constitutional challenges, Supreme Court of the United States_
2. [The Supreme Court of the United States, which currently has just eight justices, today heard the case brought by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh (''Zubik v. Burwell'', which includes similar ones by other religious organizations) that challenges the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  provision that employer-paid health insurance plans provide women with access to contraceptives at no additional out-of-pocket cost, and challenges the  federal government accommodation offered in 2014 that would have a third-party provide the coverage with costs paid by the federal government. The plaintiffs state that both are  unconstitutional because they violate  the free exercise of religion. The decision is expected in June. If the result is a split decision (4-4), there would be no national precedent and each case's final decision would be the one made in court before the case was forwarded to the Supreme Court. In the group of cases presented today,  all but one appeals court upheld the government mandate. ](/news/2016/03/23/the-supreme-court-of-the-united-states-which-currently-has-just-eight-justices-today-heard-the-case-brought-by-the-roman-catholic-diocese.md) _Context: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Supreme Court of the United States_
