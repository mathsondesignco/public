# After shooting and wounding his ex-girlfriend in Baltimore, Ismaaiyl Brinsley shoots and kills two policemen execution style in Brooklyn, New York, supposedly in revenge for the deaths of two black men in the U.S. reportedly caused by police officers during the summer of 2014, Eric Garner and Michael Brown. The gunman is later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the subway. 

The suspect posted anti-police rants on Instagram before the fatal shooting.
