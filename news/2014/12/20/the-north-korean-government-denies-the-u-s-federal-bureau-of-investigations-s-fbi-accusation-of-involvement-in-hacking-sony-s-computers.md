# The North Korean government denies the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations's (FBI) accusation of involvement in hacking Sony's computers, asking the U.S. for a joint investigation and threatening "serious consequences" if the United States refuses the offer of cooperation. 

Decrying U.S. allegations that it was behind a cyberattack on Sony Pictures as an “unfounded rumor,” North Korea on Saturday proposed a “joint investigation” into the hacking that prompted the studio to cancel the theatrical release of the comedy “The Interview,” which centers on a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un .
