# The Supreme Court of the United States rules by an 8-1 vote that evidence collected based on a reasonable misinterpretation of the law can be used at trial and is not deemed an unreasonable search or seizure. 

The Supreme Court on Monday gave police additional leeway to use evidence they find during routine traffic stops to pursue crimes.
