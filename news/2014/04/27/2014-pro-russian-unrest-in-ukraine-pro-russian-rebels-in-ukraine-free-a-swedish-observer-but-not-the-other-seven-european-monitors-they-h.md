# 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine:. Pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine free a Swedish observer, but not the other seven European monitors they have been holding for three days.

Pro-Russian rebels paraded European monitors they are holding in eastern Ukraine on Sunday, freeing one but saying they had no plans to release another seven as the United States and Europe prepared new sanctions against Moscow.
