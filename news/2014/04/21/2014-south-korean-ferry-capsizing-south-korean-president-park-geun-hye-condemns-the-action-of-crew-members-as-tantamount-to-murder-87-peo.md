# 2014 South Korean ferry capsizing:. South Korean President Park Geun-hye condemns the action of crew members as tantamount to murder. 87 people are known to have died and 238 are missing and presumed dead in the sinking of Sewol ferry on 16 April. 

JINDO, South Korea -- South Korean President Park Geun-hye on Monday likened the actions of the captain and some crew members of the sunken ferry Sewol to murder, as police made more four arrests and divers continued searching the submerged vessel. The captain of the South Korean ship, Lee Joon-seok, is already facing a series of criminal charges for his role in last week&#039;s sinking, in which at least 87 people have died and 215 others remain missing. Many of them are students and teachers on a field trip from a high school near Seoul.
