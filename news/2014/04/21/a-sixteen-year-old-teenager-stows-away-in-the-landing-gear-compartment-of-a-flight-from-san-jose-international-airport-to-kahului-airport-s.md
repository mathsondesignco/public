A 16-year-old boy survived a harrowing trip halfway across the Pacific Ocean on Sunday after climbing into the wheel well of a Hawaiian Airlines jet flying from San Jose to Maui, emerging unharmed despite freezing temperatures and a lack of oxygen on a flight that reached an altitude of 38,000 feet, an FBI official said.
