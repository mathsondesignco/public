# Censors in Australia effectively ban the award-winning Swedish film ''Children's Island'' due to scenes of child nudity, with anyone caught selling or showing the film in public risking up to ten years in prison. 

Censors have refused classification for a 30-year-old award-winning Swedish film, in effect banning it, after an application by the Australian Federal Police.
