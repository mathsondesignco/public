# 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict	In response to rocket fire six hours before the end of a cease-fire, Israeli airstrikes kill 11 Palestinians including the wife and infant son of Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif - the first deaths in a week - while Hamas launches over 130 missiles at Israel during the day. This is the 11th cease-fire broken by rocket fire from Hamas. 

Hamas says militant chief Mohammed Deif is alive and leading its response to Israeli air strikes that killed 19 people in Gaza, including his wife and child.
