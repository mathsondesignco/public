#  ''The New York Times'' reports that a website created at the request of United States Representative Peter Hoekstra and Senator Pat Roberts was found to contain detailed information which could help nuclear-capable states produce nuclear weapons.  The website was shut down on November 2 following questioning by ''The New York Times'' and protests by International Atomic Energy Agency officials. 

A federal government Web site, set up to make public Iraqi documents, included some that may constitute a basic guide to building an atom bomb.
