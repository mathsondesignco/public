#  Gol Transportes Areos Flight 1907 with 155 passengers onboard collides with a smaller jet in midair, 470 miles south of Manaus, Brazil. The Boeing 737-800 wreckage has been found by FAB near Peixoto de Azevedo 

Prosecutors could charge two American pilots of an executive jet with manslaughter following the high-altitude collision with a Brazilian jetliner that apparently led to a crash that killed all 155 people aboard, federal police said Wednesday.
