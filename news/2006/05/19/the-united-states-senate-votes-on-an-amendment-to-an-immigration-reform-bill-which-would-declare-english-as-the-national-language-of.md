#  The United States Senate votes on an amendment to an immigration reform bill which would ""... declare English as the national language of the United States"", giving English an increased "de jure" capacity (in addition to a "de facto" one) as the official language within the country. The bill, S. 2611, has yet to be voted on in the Senate. 

Lawmakers Vote For English As Both National And Unifying Language
