#  President Bush has declared space to be essential to US defence in a new National Space Policy document. Not only has the United States declared that it has rights in space, but, if necessary, it will deny its adversaries access to space if those adversaries seek to impede those rights. The new policy was agreed upon in August but the document[http:--news.bbc.co.uk-1-shared-bsp-hi-pdfs-18_10_06_usspace.pdf] was not released until 6 October.
