#  Russian President Vladimir Putin has voiced renewed opposition to the U.S. decision to abandon the 30-year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in favour of missile defence saying it would damage world security. He also claimed that Russia has developed a new category of hypersonic intercontinental missile which can zig-zag in flight and is immune to any missile defense system.
