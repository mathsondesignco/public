#  North Korea launches a 7th missile, despite earlier condemnation of its earlier tests. One of the missiles landed "near Russian territory." The U.N. Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting for Wednesday, and Japan warns of economic sanctions against the country. 

Japan drafted a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning North Korea Wednesday after Pyongyang test-fired a long-range missile earlier in the day.
