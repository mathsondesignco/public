#  The Government of Chad and the World Bank end a four-month-long dispute over allocation of Chadian petroleum funds. The World Bank will allow Chad to spend more of its oil revenue on its military in exchange for a resumption of oil output through the Chad-Cameroon pipeline. 

Chad had tried to violate its agreement with the World Bank to dedicate most of the revenues from a bank-supported oil pipeline to poverty reduction.
