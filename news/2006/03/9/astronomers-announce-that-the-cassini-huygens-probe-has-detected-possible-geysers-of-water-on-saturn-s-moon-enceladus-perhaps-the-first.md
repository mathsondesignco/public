Data sent back from the probe via the Cassini orbiter is now being analysed. Three low-resolution pictures have been released, including one from an altitude of 16&nbsp;km that appears to show channels cut by liquid, and another from the surface of Titan showing rocks or ice. ](/news/2005/01/14/in-what-is-expected-to-be-one-of-the-major-scientific-events-of-this-decade-the-huygens-probe-successfully-lands-on-saturn-s-largest-moon.md) _Context: Cassini probe, Saturn_
