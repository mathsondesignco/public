4. [ The cabinet of Balkenende resigns. Because of the constant internal fighting in the new party LPF, the other two governing parties, CDA and VVD decided that continuing the coalition was impossible.

The Netherlands cabinet was already divided on the issue and if new elections are to be held it may take 4-5 months before another cabinet is installed that is willing to make a decision.](/news/2002/10/16/the-cabinet-of-balkenende-resigns-because-of-the-constant-internal-fighting-in-the-new-party-lpf-the-other-two-governing-parties-cda-and.md) _Context: LPF, Politics of the Netherlands_
