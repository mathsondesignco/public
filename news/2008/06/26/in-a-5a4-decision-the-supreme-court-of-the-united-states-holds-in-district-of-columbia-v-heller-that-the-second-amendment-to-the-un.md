#  In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States holds in ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects an individual right to own a firearm and keep it on their property, ruling a District of Columbia gun control law unconstitutional and putting many other similar measures in jeopardy.
