#  Supreme Court of the United States: In ''United States v. Santos'', by a 5-4 decision, the United States Supreme Court takes a narrow interpretation of federal laws regarding money laundering, and uses the decision in ''Cuellar v. United States'' to unanimously overturn the money laundering conviction of Humberto Cuellar. 

The Supreme Court on Monday ruled against the government in two money laundering cases, making it more difficult for prosecutors to use an important weapon in the war on drugs and organized crime.
