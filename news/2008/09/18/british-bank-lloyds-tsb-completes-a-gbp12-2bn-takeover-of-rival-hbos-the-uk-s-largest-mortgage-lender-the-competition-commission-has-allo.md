#  British bank Lloyds TSB completes a GBP12.2bn takeover of rival HBOS, the UK's largest mortgage lender. The Competition Commission has allowed the deal as it has government backing, despite the fact that it will leave Lloyd's HBOS in control of a third of the UK mortgage market. 

The federal government, trying to boost investor confidence in the face of a market crisis, took the dramatic step Friday of temporarily banning betting against financial stocks.
