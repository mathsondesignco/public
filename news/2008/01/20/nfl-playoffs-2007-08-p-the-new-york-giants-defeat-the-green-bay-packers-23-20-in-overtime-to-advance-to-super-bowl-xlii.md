#  NFL playoffs, 2007-08: The New York Giants defeat the Green Bay Packers 23-20 in overtime to advance to Super Bowl XLII. 

Despite a shaky Tom Brady, the New England Patriots were still too much for the banged-up San Diego Chargers in the AFC Championship Game Sunday, pulling out a 21-12 victory that sent them back to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in seven seasons.
