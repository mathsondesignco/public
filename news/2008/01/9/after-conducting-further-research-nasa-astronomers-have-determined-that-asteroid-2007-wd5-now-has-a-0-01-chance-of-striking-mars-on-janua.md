The object, estimated to be 50 meters wide, could impact Mars with the force of about three megatons of TNT. The potential strike area is close to the location of the Opportunity rover. ](/news/2007/12/28/nasa-astronomers-refine-the-trajectory-of-new-asteroid-2007-wd5-giving-it-a-1-in-25-4-chance-of-striking-mars-on-january-30-2008-the.md) _Context: 2007 WD5, Mars, NASA_
