#  2008 Sichuan earthquake: The death toll from the earthquake reaches 32,477, with 14,000 still missing and 205,000 people evacuated. 

Hope drained out of this mountain valley Saturday as thousands of homeless residents came to realize a grim truth - there is precious little, if any, time remaining to find more survivors of the devastating earthquake. Rescue workers did manage to pull 33 survivors from the rubble of towns and villages Saturday throughout the larger county in the quake zone, also called Beichuan, including 11-year-old Deng Bo, who gave a slight wave as he was trundled into an ambulance. [...] locals, citing far larger numbers of people buried in the rubble, say the final tally will be much higher. Frantic parents watched worriedly as rescue workers used cranes, shovels and hands to scour the rubble of a middle school where more than 1,000 teenagers were buried. Some walked seemingly shell-shocked over shaky roads to pick through the rubble of their homes and gather a few belongings - blankets, clothes, even televisions - to take with them. Though the government has mobilized nearly 150,000 soldiers for the rescue and relief in western China, panic ensued Saturday on fears that two rivers blocked by landslides would flood Beichuan and other towns. Along the roads, makeshift tents made from sticks, tarps and any other useful items provide shelter for those who lost homes, or remain afraid to sleep inside.
